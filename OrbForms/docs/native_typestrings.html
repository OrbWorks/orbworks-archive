<p>Many types of native functions and methods have an interest in serializing
and de-serializing user data, such as the way many built-in methods do. For
example, both DBRecord.write and Preferences.set take a pointer to arbitrary
user data and serialize the data according to a user specified type string. To
help native functions and methods process these <a href="ttypeStrings.html">type
strings</a>, the OrbC native interface supplies a few helpful functions. See
the OrbSerial sample to see these functions in action.</p>
<h3>Memory Iteration</h3>
<p>The type string functions operate by iterating over a block of memory where each
Value in the memory block is processed according to the <a href="ttypeStrings.html">type
string</a>. If the data in the block of memory is not compatible
with the type string, a runtime error will be raised. When using the <code>ts_iterate</code>
function, you provide a <code>NATIVE_TS_ITER</code> callback function. This
callback function is called once for each Value in memory. Along with a pointer
to the Value in memory, this callback function is also provided with the type
and size as defined in the type string. The following table maps the type string
values to the resulting function parameters:</p>
<p><code><b>typedef bool (*NATIVE_TS_ITER)(OrbFormsInterface*, Value* val,
VarType type, int size, void* context)</b></code></p>

<p>When an object type id is encountered it is skipped rather than being passed 
to the native add-in.</p>
