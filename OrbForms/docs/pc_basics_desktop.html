<p>PocketC Architect Desktop is a Windows-based editor and compiler
for the OrbC language.</p>

<h3>Building a Project</h3>

<p>Selecting Project | Build Project compiles the current project file using the 
settings in the Compile dialog and the properties in the <code>@app</code> 
resource. The first source file opened is considered to be the project file. To 
explicitly change the project file, select Project | Set Project File or 
right-click within a file and select Set as Project.</p>

<h3>Compile Dialog </h3>

<p>The compile dialog gives you two options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>Generate standalone application </i><b>- </b>Selecting this check box 
  will create a standalone application - a .prc file which contains an embedded 
  runtime and any required native add-ins. When developing an application, it is 
  generally better not to create standalone applications, because using the 
  debug version of OrbFormsRT-debug.prc will enable you to find bugs in your 
  code more easily. When distributing an application, it is best to use 
  standalone applications so that your users will only need to install one file. 
  Legacy PocketC native libraries are not embedded in a standalone application.
  <i>The demo version is not able to build standalone applications, so this 
  checkbox will be disabled.</i></li>
  <li><i>Enable debug code</i>- Selecting this checkbox enables all the features 
  provided by the <a href="tDebug.html">debug support</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>File Extensions</h3>
<p>PocketC Architect uses three file extensions. The compiler and editor treats 
all files types the same, but their intent is as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>OrbC Project File (.ocp)</i> - An OrbC source file which is the primary 
  project file. If other files are used in the project, they are included from 
  this file. Generally the application resources are also defined in this file.</li>
  <li><i>OrbC Source File (.oc)</i> - An OrbC source file other than the primary 
  project file. It is convenient to use a separate .oc file for each form and 
  gadget implementation in your application.</li>
  <li><i>PocketC Source File (.pc)</i> - A legacy PocketC source file.</li>
</ul>
<h3>QuickDocs</h3>
<p>When you place the cursor on a function name, it displays the function
declaration along with short documentation. The documentation for built-in
functions is provided by the compiler. However, you can add documentation to
your own functions very easily by adding an @doc directive before the function
definition. For example:</p>
<pre>@doc &quot;Create a new button&quot;;
addButton(int x, int y, string name) { ... }</pre>
<h3>Uploading to the Emulator or Simulator</h3>
<p>The application's .prc will be automatically installed on the
emulator or simulator if it is running. If the .prc file on the device is in use (i.e.
the application is running), the file will not upload successfully. Select 
Options | Upload on Build to enable or disable this feature.</p>
<h3>Automatic Updates</h3>
<p>PocketC Architect can automatically look for updates each time it is run. Select 
Options | Auto Update to enable or disable this feature. Checking for updates 
involves downloading a version info file from the OrbWorks server. No personally 
identifiable information is transfered.</p>
<h3>Compiling from the Command Line</h3>
<p>To compile a project from the command line, you can use the included command 
line compiler, oc.exe.</p>
<p><code>oc.exe -pocketc [-standalone] [-debug] project.ocp</code></p>
<p>The -pocketc switch must always be used to provide PocketC compatibility. The 
remaining switches relate directly to the options specified in the Compile 
dialog when building from the editor.</p>
