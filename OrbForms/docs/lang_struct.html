<p>A structure is a user defined data type that is a
collection of other data types. For example, a Person data type can be defined
as a string containing the person's name, and an integer representing the
person's age like this:</p>

<pre>struct Person {
  string name;
  int age;
};</pre>

<p>After being declared, Person can be used like the built-in data types (e.g.
int, string). To access the data in a structure, use the dot (.) operator like this:</p>

<pre>Person bob; // create a Person variable named 'bob'
bob.name = &quot;Bob&quot;; // assign &quot;Bob&quot; to the name member of 'bob'
bob.age = 26;</pre>

<p>When using a pointer to a struct, you must use the <code>-&gt;</code>
operator, rather than the <code>.</code> operator, to access the data in the structure, like this:</p>

<pre>Person* pBob; // create a Person pointer name 'pBob'
pBob = new Person; // allocate a new Person object, and assign the address to 'pBob'
pBob-&gt;name = &quot;Bob&quot;; // set the name member of the Person that 'pBob' points to
pBob-&gt;age = 18;</pre>

<p>Structs may also contain other structs (or objects) as members. When a struct
contains another struct, multiple <code>.</code> operators must be used. For
example:</p>

<pre>struct City {
  int population;
  Person mayor;
};
City hudson;
...
hudson.mayor.age++; // happy birthday</pre>

<p>Structs can be initialized like other data types, but must
be enclosed in braces and each member must be initialized in the order in which
they were declared, like this:</p>

<pre>Person bob = { &quot;Bob&quot;, 72 };
City hudson = { 45000, { &quot;Mayor John&quot;, 48 } };</pre>

<p>Structures can be copied just like other variables, by using the assignment operator (=):</p>

<pre>Person bob = { &quot;Bob&quot;, 54 }, andy = { &quot;Andy&quot;, 32 };
bob = andy; // copies all the data from 'andy' to 'bob'
alert(bob.name); // displays &quot;Andy&quot;</pre>

<p>Unlike other variable types, structure and object parameters are passed by
reference. When a structure is passed to a function, the entire structure is not
copied. Instead, when the structure parameter is accessed, the original
structure is accessed, not a local copy. For example:</p>

<pre>struct Person {
  string name;
}

void bob(Person person) {
  person.name = &quot;bob&quot;; // this affects the original variable 'andy'
}

void test() {
  Person andy = { &quot;Andy&quot; };
  bob(andy); // pass a reference to 'andy'
  // andy.name is now &quot;Bob&quot;
}</pre>
