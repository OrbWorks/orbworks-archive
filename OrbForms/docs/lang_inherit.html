<p>Object inheritance allows you to define a new object type by extending and 
specializing an existing object type.</p>
<h3>Extending</h3>
<p>When you create a <i>derived</i> object from a <i>base</i> object, the 
derived object inherits all the methods and members of the base object type. A 
derived type can only have one base type - this is called single inheritance. As 
in other object-oriented languages, a base class can have its own base class, 
allowing a deep inheritance tree (e.g. Lion inherits from Cat which inherits 
from Animal). To 
declare such a derived object type, you must follow the name of the derived type 
by a colon and the name of the base type:</p>

<pre>// base object
object Tree {
  string name;
  void grow();
};

// derived object
object FruitTree : Tree {
  string fruit;
};</pre>

<p>In the example above, the Tree is an object that represents a real-world tree 
- it has a name (such as &quot;maple&quot;) and a method that makes it grow. The FruitTree 
is a special kind of Tree which also has the name of the fruit (such as 
&quot;apple&quot;). Because the FruitTree inherits from Tree, it has all the same methods 
and members as a Tree. Thus, a FruitTree can be used like this:</p>
<pre>FruitTree appleTree;
appleTree.name = "Apple tree"; // name is inherited from Tree
appleTree.fruit = "apple";
appleTree.grow(); // grow() is also inherited from Tree</pre>
<h3>Pointers</h3>
<p>Because a derived object has all the methods and members as its base, a 
pointer to the derived type can be used any place that a pointer to the base is 
expected.</p>
<pre>// this function expects a pointer to a Tree
// a pointer to any object derived from a Tree will also work
void GrowATree(Tree* tree) {
  tree->grow();
}

void MakeATree() {
  FruitTree* appleTree;
  appleTree = new FruitTree;
  GrowATree(appleTree); // passing a FruitTree to a function expecting a Tree
}</pre>
<h3>Specializing</h3>
<p>You can specialize the behavior of a derived object by using virtual methods. 
A virtual method is a method that is defined for a base class and (optionally) 
overrided in derived classes to provide a specialized implementation. When a virtual 
method is called through a base object pointer, the specialized version of the 
method is called based on the object's actual type. To create a virtual method, use the
<code>virtual</code> keyword
in the base class (the method in the derived class is automatically virtual). An example makes this more 
clear:</p>
<pre>object Animal {
  virtual string speak();
};
string Animal.speak() { return "(silence)"; }

object Dog : Animal {
  string speak();
};
string Dog.speak() { return "woof"; }

object Cat : Animal {
  string speak();
};
string Cat.speak() { return "meow"; }

object Lion : Cat { // a derived object can inherit from another derived object
  string speak();
};
string Lion.speak() { return "roar"; }

void TalkToTheAnimals(Animal* animals, int count) {
  int i;
  for (i = 0; i &lt; count; i++) {
    // although 'animals' is an array of Animal pointers,
    // at runtime the actual type pointed to by each
    // pointer is determined (e.g. Dog, Cat), and the
    // correct method is called (e.g Dog.speak())
    alert(animals[i]-&gt;speak());
  }
}

void MakeAnimals() {
  Animal* animals[4];
  animals[0] = new Animal;
  animals[1] = new Dog;
  animals[2] = new Cat;
  animals[3] = new Lion;
  TalkToTheAnimals(animals, 4); // displays (silence), woof, meow, and roar
}</pre>
<p>Often when specializing a method from a base object, it is useful to call the 
base object's implementation. This can be done using the <code>base</code> keyword. For 
example, a BigDog might want to make the same sound as a Dog, only louder (in 
all UPPERCASE). This is accomplished like this:</p>
<pre>object BigDog : Dog {
  string speak();
};
string BigDog.speak() {
  string sound;
  sound = base.speak(); // calls Dog.speak(), returning woof
  return strupr(sound); // return WOOF
}</pre>
<h3>Special methods (_init, _destroy, _copy)</h3>
<p>In derived classes, the special methods have some special behavior. The 
_init() method automatically calls the base _init() method as well as the 
_init() methods of all member objects before entering the method body. The 
_destroy() method automatically calls the base _destroy() method as well as the 
_destroy() method of all member objects after exiting the method body. All 
_destroy() methods are automatically virtual. The _copy() method automatically 
calls the base _copy() method as well as the _copy() method of all member 
objects before entering the method.</p>
<h3>Objects vs. Structs</h3>
<p>A struct and an object are very similar - they both support methods and 
members. However, an object cannot inherit from a struct and only objects may 
inherit from other objects and interfaces.</p>
