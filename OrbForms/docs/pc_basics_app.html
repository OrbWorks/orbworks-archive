<p>Creating an application with PocketC Architect is done by declaring the 
application properties, declaring the forms and controls, and implementing 
handlers for the events. This topic walks you through these steps to create a 
simple application.</p>
<h3>Define Application Properties</h3>
<p>The first step in creating an application is to declare the app and set its 
properties. To do this, use the <a href="tResources.html">OrbC resource language</a>, 
for example:</p>
<pre>@app myApp {
  creator = "MyAp"; // creator id
  name = "App Name"; // display name
  dbname = "AppName-MyAp"; // name of .prc database
}</pre>
<p>After declaring the application, you will need to implement at handler for 
the onstart event, discussed below.</p>
<h3>Create Forms</h3>
<p>An application needs at least one form. The following is a simple form with a 
single button:</p>
<pre>@form myForm {
  id = 1000
  text = "My Form"
  x = 0, y = 0, w = 160, h = 160

  button myButton {
    id = 1001
    x = 60, y = 80, w = 40, h = 12
    text = "My Button"
  }
}
</pre>
<p>The code above declares a form named <code>myForm</code>, containing a 
button named <code>myButton</code>. 
Both the form and the button use default values for all optional properties, e.g. a full screen non-modal form, a button 
with a standard frame and standard font. One thing you may notice is that both objects declared above have names and ids. Each 
id must be unique within the application, and must be less than 9000. Each name 
must also be unique.</p>
<p>The most interesting parts of the declaration above are the names of the 
objects. Declaring an app, form, or control actually creates a global variable 
by that name which can be referenced in code, and is used in implementing 
handlers.</p>
<h3>Implement Handlers</h3>
<p>In order for an application to do anything, it must handle events. An event 
is handled by declaring an event handler, which is similar to a method - for 
complete details, see <a href="tEvents.html">Event Handlers</a>. All 
applications must implement the app handler onstart, which must load the main 
form:</p>
<pre>handler myApp.onstart() {
  myForm.load();
}</pre>
<p>To make the application more useful, implement handlers for the rest of the 
objects. For example, the following code will cause an alert to be displayed 
when the <code>myButton</code> is pressed:</p>
<pre>handler myButton.onselect() {
  alert("Button pressed");
}
</pre>
