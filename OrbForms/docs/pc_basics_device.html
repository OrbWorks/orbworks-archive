<p>PocketC Architect is a PalmOS-based compiler for the OrbC language.</p>
<h3>Installing Source Code</h3>

<p>Source code can be copied from your computer by running the Palm Desktop application,
creating a new memo, and copying the source code to the new memo. PocketC 
architect also supports PDOC files, such as those created by Qed, SrcEdit, or 
TealDoc.</p>

<h3>Writing an Application</h3>

<p>A PocketC Architect application can be written as a memo or a PDOC file. When 
using a memo, the first line of the
source code must be a
//-style comment which states the name of the file with a .ocp or .oc extension. If the source code is a
doc file, it's name must end in .ocp or .oc in order to be
displayed in the source code list.<br>
Example: <code>&quot;// Hello World.ocp&quot;</code>.<br>
<br>
You may also write source code on your computer, copy it to a memo (with the Palm Desktop
software), and Hotsync. </p>

<h3>Compiling an Application</h3>

<p>Select the source file that you would like to compile, and press the Compile button. 
The source 
code list displays all source files that end in .ocp or .orb (to make compiler 
OrbForms applications easy). If the Show classic PocketC checkbox is checked, 
all memo's that begin with // and all docs that end in .c or .pc will also be 
displayed in the list.</p>
<p>Selecting the Debug checkbox enables all the runtime features provided by the
<a href="tDebug.html">debug support</a>.</p>
<p>Once an application is successfully compiled, return to the application 
launcher to run it. In the case of an error, an alert will popup to indicate the 
location and type of the first error, with an option to jump to the error 
location.</p>

<h3>Launching PocketC Architect from an Editor</h3>
<p>If you are developing an editor, you can launch PocketC Architect to compile a given 
file. To do this, use the code snippet below to pass the name of the file (as it 
would be displayed in PocketC's source code list).</p>
<pre>#define sysAppLaunchCmdCompile (sysAppLaunchCmdCustomBase + 1)
char* name = (char*)MemPtrNew(33);
StrCopy(name, "NameOfFile");
MemPtrSetOwner(name, 0); // so that the OS doesn't clean up when the app exits
AppLaunchWithCommand('PCAr', sysAppLaunchCmdCompile, name);
</pre>
<p>This will launch PocketC Architect and begin compiling the 
file specified. If you would like PocketC Architect to also give you the results 
of the compile, use this code below:</p>
<pre>#define sysAppLaunchCmdCompileAndReturn (sysAppLaunchCmdCustomBase + 2)
char* name = (char*)MemPtrNew(38); // room for file + creator id
StrCopy(name, "NameOfFile,&lt;id&gt;");
MemPtrSetOwner(name, 0); // so that the OS doesn't clean up when the app exits
AppLaunchWithCommand('PCAr', sysAppLaunchCmdCompileAndReturn, name);
</pre>
<p>This will cause PocketC Architect to compile the specified file. After the 
compile, it will launch the app whose creator id is specified after the comma in 
the command line. In the snippet above, the creator id is &quot;&lt;id&gt;&quot;. When the 
specified app is launched, it will be launched with the a launch code of 0x8001 
and a parameter block which is a string containing the results. The results 
string is either &quot;0&quot; if the compile failed, or &quot;1,&lt;id&gt;&quot; if the compile 
succeeded. If it succeeded, &quot;&lt;id&gt;&quot; is the creator id of the application just 
compiled.</p>
<p>Calling the compiler in this way can also be done from an OrbC application 
using the launchCustomString() function. For example, to compile "file.ocp" from an application whose
creator id is "Shll", use this code:</p>
<pre>launchCustomString("PCAr", 0x8002, "file.ocp,Shll");</pre>
