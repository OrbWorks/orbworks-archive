<p><strong>Note:</strong> Pointers are an advanced topic, which should be dealt
with after the user is familiar with all the other programming concepts.</p>
<p>All variables are stored at some address in memory. A pointer is a variable
which holds the address of another variable - using the pointer the value of the
original variable can be indirectly accessed (a process called
&quot;dereferencing&quot;). A pointer can be used with only one value type (<code>int</code>,
<code>string</code>, <code>struct</code>, etc.) - for example an integer pointer can only be used to
access an integer. A pointer is declared in the same way as a normal variable
with the addition of an asterisk (*) after the type name.</p>
<p>There are two primary operators which are used with pointers, * and &amp;.
The * operator dereferences the pointer. A dereferenced pointer acts just like
the data to which it points. The &amp; operator returns the address of a given
variable. To illustrate:</p>
<pre>int* p, q; // <b>Note:</b> unlike in C/C++, this declares p and q to <b>BOTH</b> be pointers
int i;

void test() {
  i = 5;
  p = &amp;i;    // Assign the address of 'i' to the pointer 'p'
             // now, typing '*p' is the same as typing 'i'
  alert(*p); // Display the value of 'i'
  *p = 7;    // Assign 7 to 'i'
  q = p;     // Assign the value of 'p', which is the address of 'i', to 'q'
             // now, typing '*q' is the also the same as typing 'i'

  // Things not to do
  p = 8;     // BAD! Don't assign a literal value to a pointer
  *i = 9;    // BAD! Don't try to dereference a non-pointer
}</pre>

<p>When initially declared, the pointers will have the value <code>null</code> (which is
equivalent to 0), which means they point to nothing and cannot be dereferenced.</p>

<h3>Pointers and arrays</h3>
<p>Pointers and arrays are fairly similar. Pointers can use the [] operator, and an
array variable (when not used with []) results in the address of the first
element. For example:</p>
<pre>int array[5];
int* p;

void test() {
  p = array; // Assign the address of the first element of
             // 'array' to 'p'
  *p = 7;    // Assign 7 to array[0]
  p[1] = 8;  // Assign 8 to array[1]
}</pre>
<p>This enables the pointers to arrays to be passed as function parameters. This
also allows the user to implement their own version of two-dimensional arrays
(multi-dimensional arrays will be implemented in a future version). By creating an array of pointers, each of which is a pointer to an array (or
part of one), a two-dimensional array can be simulated.</p>
<pre>int array[100];
int* twod[10]; // after init(), this can be treated
               // like at 10x10 matrix

void init() {
  int i;
  for (i=0;i&lt;10;i++)
    twod[i]=array + i*10; // Pointer arithmetic
}

void test() {
  int x, y;
  init();
  for (x=0;x&lt;10;x++)
    for (y=0;y&lt;10;y++)
      twod[x][y]=x * y; // Sets array[x*10 + y] = x*y
}</pre>

<h3>Pointer arithmetic</h3>
<p>Pointer values can used in a limited number of expression. You can add and
subtract from a pointer (and, thus, can use the increment and decrement
operators as well). When you add 1 to a pointer, the pointer points to the next
value in memory. Similarly, when you subtract 1 from a pointer, the pointer
points to the previous value in memory. When you add to or subtract from a
pointer to a structure/object, the pointer is changed by the number of
structures specified, rather than the number of memory values (see example
below). Caution should be used when using
pointer arithmetic, because dereferencing an invalid memory location will cause
an error in the applet.</p>

<pre>struct Person {
  string name;
  int age;
};
...
Person people[10];
Person* pPerson;
pPerson = &amp;people[4]; // pPerson now points to the 4th person
pPerson++;            // pPerson now points to the 5th person</pre>

<h3>Dynamically allocating memory (new and delete)</h3>
<p>The OrbC language allows you to dynamically allocate memory at runtime.
Two of the most common uses of this are allocating an array whose length cannot
be determined before the program is run, and creating structures and objects
(discussed soon).</p>

<p>To allocate a new block of memory, use the new keyword. The new keyword takes
the name of the type to allocate and returns a pointer to the allocated memory
(or null if the allocation fails). For example:</p>

<pre>int* pi;
string* ps;
pi = new int;
ps = new string;
*pi = 6;
*ps = &quot;Hello&quot;;</pre>

<p>The new keyword can also create arrays by specifying the number of desired
elements in brackets after the type name:</p>

<pre>int count = 10;
int* parray;
string* psarray;
parray = new int[10]; // allocate an array of 10 integers
psarray = new string[count * 2]; // allocates count*2 strings
if (parray != null) { // since dynamic memory may run out,
  parray[3] = 45;     // you should check that new succeeded
}                     // before using the pointer!
if (psarray) { // this is the same as (psarray != null)
  psarray[12] = &quot;twelve&quot;;
}</pre>

<p>Once the memory is no longer needed, it must be freed using the delete
operator. The delete operator takes a pointer to memory previously allocated by
new. The pointer could have been allocated either as a single value, or as an
array - if the pointer is null, it will safely do nothing.</p>

<pre>delete pi; // delete the integer pointed to by pi
delete parray; // deletes the entire array pointed to by parray
delete null; // does nothing</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b> The runtime also provides two methods for dealing with less
structured memory allocations: malloct, and free.</p>
