<p>The OrbC runtime is built around a stack-based virtual machine. The
virtual machine's memory is represented by Values, as defined in OrbNative.h.
The following text describes the architectural aspects that are important to a
native add-in.</p>
<h3>Values</h3>
<p>A Value is a union of the supported basic data types - int, float, string,
and char. ints, floats, and chars are stored directly in the Value structure.
Strings, however, are stored as ref-counted handles.</p>
<p>Other types supported by the language, such as pointers and bools, are
treated as ints by the virtual machine.</p>
<h3>Strings</h3>
<p>There are two types of strings supported by the virtual machine: constant
and shared. A constant string is just a pointer to some constant data, usually a
string literal in C++ code. A shared string is a handle to a ref-counted
structure containing the string's data. This structure is not exposed directly
to the
native add-ins. Instead, functions are provided to create and modify these
strings.</p>
<h3>Function calls</h3>
<p>In order to implement a function in a native add-in, your code must pop all
the arguments off the stack, do something useful, and then (optionally) set the
return value. If you declare your function with a return type, you MUST set a
return value.</p>
<p>The calling convention for functions is quite simple. Each argument is pushed
onto the stack from left to right, which means that the last argument will be on top of
the stack. For example, an add function declared as &quot;<code>int add(int x, int y)</code>&quot;
looks like this:</p>
<pre>void add(OrbFormsInterface* ofi) {
  Value* y = ofi-&gt;vm_pop(); // pop the last arg
  Value* x = ofi-&gt;vm_pop(); // pop the first arg
  ofi-&gt;vm_retVal-&gt;type = vtInt; // set the return type
  ofi-&gt;vm_retVal-&gt;iVal = x-&gt;iVal + y-&gt;iVal;
}</pre>
<p><b>Note</b>: If your function takes an object (or structure) as a parameter, this is
converted to a pointer by the compiler. So, a function declared as &quot;<code>void
box(Point top_left, Point bottom_right)</code>&quot; will be implemented as if it were
&quot;<code>void box(<b>Point*</b> top_left, <b>Point*</b> bottom_right)</code>&quot;.</p>
<h3>Method calls</h3>
<p>A method call is the same as function call, but the compiler inserts a
parameter to the beginning of the parameter list which is a pointer to the
object. For example, &quot;<code>void Point.add(int x, int y)</code>&quot; will be
implemented as &quot;<code>void Point_add(<b>Point*</b> this, int x, int y)&quot;</code>.</p>
<h3>Returning objects</h3>
<p>If a function returns an object (or structure), the compiler adds a pointer
to the return location as the first parameter. For a method that returns an
object (or structure), the &quot;this&quot; pointer gets moved to the second parameter. In
addition to filling in the structure passed as the first parameter, a function
or method must also set the virtual machine's return value to type point to this
same structure.</p>
<pre>struct Point { int x, int y; };
Point makePt(int x, int y) @ library(&quot;AddInName&quot;, 0);

void makePt(OrbFormsInterface* ofi) {
  Value* y = ofi-&gt;vm_pop();
  Value* x = ofi-&gt;vm_pop();
  Value* optr = ofi-&gt;vm_pop(); // pointer to return struct
  Value* o_x = ofi-&gt;vm_deref(optr-&gt;iVal); // dereference the struct pointer to
  Value* o_y = ofi-&gt;vm_deref(optr-&gt;iVal + 1); // get pointers to the two fields
  // fill in the return struct
  o_x-&gt;iVal = x-&gt;iVal;
  o_y-&gt;iVal = y-&gt;iVal;
  // return the pointer as well!
  ofi-&gt;vm_retVal-&gt;type = vtInt;
  ofi-&gt;vm_retVal-&gt;iVal = optr-&gt;iVal;
}</pre>
<h3>Properties</h3>
<p>A property is similar to a field in an object (or structure) - except that it
is not actually stored in the object's memory. Instead, the value of the
property is get and set by
calling a native function. A property may only be a simple type, not an object or
structure.</p>
<p>Getting and setting a property is implemented as a method call. A
&quot;get&quot; method takes a pointer to the object and returns the property
value. A &quot;set&quot; method takes a pointer to the object and the new property
value, returning a copy of the new property value. For example, if you implemented <code>Point</code> as a native 
struct with <code>x</code> as a
read-write property:</p>
<pre>struct Point { int x @ library(&quot;AddInName&quot;, 0:1); };</pre>
<p>the methods that get and set the properties would be implemented like this:</p>
<pre>int Point_get_x(Point* this)
int Point_set_x(Point* this, int new_x)</pre>
<h3>Object/Struct Memory Layout</h3>
<p>All the fields in an object and structure are laid out in memory in the
same order as they are declared. Methods and properties require no space in the
struct. For example:</p>
<pre>struct Point {
  int x; // location 0
  int y; // location 1
};
struct NativeStruct {
  int id; // location 0
  void method(); // no space
  string prop @ library(&quot;AddInName&quot;, 1:2); // no space
  int state; // location 1
  Point pt; // locations 2 and 3
};</pre>
<p>The memory layout for an object is slightly different than a struct. The 
first memory location in an object is an object type id used by the runtime 
engine. For example:</p>
<pre>object Point {
  // location 0 is object type id
  int x; // location 1
  int y; // location 2
  void setPoint(int x, int y); // no space
};
</pre>
