<p>The OrbForms Designer environment consists of many tools to increase your
productivity while creating applications - a Workspace bar containing the
project view and source view, a Visual Designer for manipulation forms and
controls, an Inspection bar listing properties of the current object, and Output
bar showing build output, and a Source editor window for creating your
application's source code.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="frontview.gif" width="655" height="461"></img></p>
<h3>Workspace Bar - Project</h3>
<p>The Project view of the Workspace bar contains all of the resources in your
application displayed in a tree. Selecting an item will display its properties
in the Inspection bar, allowing you to edit it's attributes. Right-clicking on
an item will display a menu of operations that can be performed on the item.</p>
<p>Each project can have following resources:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>app</i>:&nbsp; determines the basic project properties like project 
  name, creator id.&nbsp; </li>
  <li><i>forms</i>: contains all the forms in the project.&nbsp; Each project 
  can have unlimited number of forms.</li>
  <li><i>bitmaps</i>: contains all the bitmaps this project needed.&nbsp; For 
  example, a button's UI can be text or graphic.&nbsp; If the button has graphic 
  user interface, the user can pick a bitmap from this list.</li>
  <li><i>Strings</i>: contains all the strings.&nbsp; For example, a form could 
  have help strings, and the user can pick a list of possible strings to be the 
  form's helper string.&nbsp; That list is generated from the list of strings in 
  the project resource.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Workspace Bar - Source</h3>
<p>The Source view of the Workspace bar contains all the source code in the 
application, including gadget files. Right-click a source file to move it up or 
down in the list, which controls the order in which the files are compiled and 
the functions and objects are defined. Double-clicking a file will open it and 
display a list of the functions, methods, handlers, and objects defined in the 
file. Double-clicking one of the functions, etc. will jump to the function in 
the source editor.</p>
<p>Each project can have following type of source files:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Gadget Files</i>: contain a list of files where custom gadgets are 
  defined.&nbsp; Each file should only contain one gadget.</li>
  <li><i>Source Files</i>:: contains a list of source code files.</li>
  <li><i>Language Files</i>: contains a list of localized <a href="tTranslation.html">language resource</a> files. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Form Designer</h3>
<p>The Form Designer is the place where the user interface is created and
tweaked. The view displayed in the Form Designer is very similar to the way
the application will appear on an actual device (some controls are drawn
slightly differently to make them easier to edit, such as the field control).</p>

    <td width="78%"><b>Key Features:</b><P><b><i>Drag and drop controls</i></b> 
    - click the left mouse button to select a control, and hold the mouse to 
    move the controls to the desired position on the screen.&nbsp; The control's 
    position is relative to the form position.&nbsp; If the Form designer's grid 
    snap is enabled, the control movements are snapped to the closest point on 
    the grid.&nbsp; </P>
<P><i><b>Select controls </b></i>- </P>
    <ul>
      <li>Select one control: left click on a control to select the control.&nbsp; 
      </li>
      <li>Select more than 1 control at once: Press Shift key and continue left 
      click on a control.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Select controls that are covered by another control: Press Alt key 
      while left click on a control.&nbsp; </li>

Up or Move Down.</P>
<P><i><b>Align multiple controls</b></i>:&nbsp; Select multiple controls, and

<h3>Inspection Bar</h3>
<p>The Inspection bar shows the properties of the currently selected object. The
Inspection Bar, Workspace Bar, and Visual Designer are synchronized - selecting
an object in the Workspace Bar shows the properties in the Inspection Bar;
changing a property in the Inspection Bar will affect the display in the
Workspace Bar and Visual Designer.</p>

    example:&nbsp; When a form's Modal property is set to False, Default Button 
    and Help properties are disabled.&nbsp; </p>
    <p><i><b>Customize Event Handling</b></i>: allows the user to go to a 
    customized event handler function or automatically generate the handler 
    code.&nbsp; When the source file is saved, the event handler properties are

    <p><i><b>Built-in Help</b></i>: When a property or event handler is 
    selected, its description is displayed on the bottom panel.</p>
    <p><i><b>Input Error Detection</b></i>: Property's input values are 
    validated.&nbsp; For example, if a string&nbsp; is entered in the position 
    property X, Y, W, H, an error message will popup and indicating the input is 
    not valid.</p>
    <p><b>Sort Property by Name</b>: The properties can be displayed sorted base 
    on their names.<b> </b></td>
