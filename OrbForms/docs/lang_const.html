<p>It is often useful to give names to important constants. This makes source
code more readable. You can do this by defining a constant using the <code>const</code>
keyword, or by creating an enumeration using the <code>enum</code> keyword. A
constant is defined the same way a variable is, but begins with the <code>const</code>
keyword. A constant can only be created for the five simple types. For example:</p>

<pre>const float pi = 3.141592;
const string version = &quot;1.0&quot;;</pre>

<p>Enumerations are a way of creating a group of related integer contants. Each
enumeration name is put in a list, and can be given an explicit value (such a
four, below). If an explicit value is not given, the compiler will provide a
default value - the value for each name is 1 greater than the previous name, and
0 for the first name. To clarify:</p>

<pre>enum { zero, one, two, four = 4, five };</pre>

<p><b>Note</b>: constants and enumerations are treated by the compiler at a low level.
Because of this, whenever the compiler sees
the name of a constant or enum, it treats it as if it was the defined value. If
the programmer attempts to define a variable or function with the same name as a
constant/enum, the compiler will give an error saying that an identifier was
expected.</p>
