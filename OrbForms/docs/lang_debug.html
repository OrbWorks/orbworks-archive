<p>OrbC provides several features that aid developers in debugging 
code:</p>
<ul>
  <li>assertions</li>
  <li>debug logging</li>
  <li>debug only code blocks</li>
  <li>runtime functions</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the features are only available when the project is built in debug 
mode. These features generate no code in non-debug builds, which means you can 
keep all your debugging code in place without degrading the 
performance/experience of your shipping code. In addition to the features below,
when building a debug build, the DEBUG preprocessor symbol will be defined.</p>
<h3>Assertions</h3>
<p>An assertion tests an assumption that a developer makes when writing code, 
displaying an error if the specified condition is not true. Assertions do not 
generate any code in non-debug builds. Using assertions 
liberally is a great way to ensure that otherwise difficult bugs are found early 
in the development cycle. An assertion looks very similar to function call using 
the <code>assert</code> keyword:</p>
<pre>void setAge(int age) {
  <b>assert</b>(age > 0);
  // do something with age
}</pre>
<p>The function above takes an age as a parameter. Age cannot be negative, so 
this function expects the parameter to always be positive. If a number less than 
1 is ever passed to this function, the code above will cause an error message to 
be displayed containing &quot;assert(age &gt; 0)&quot; and the call stack causing the error.</p>
<h3>Debug Logging</h3>
<p>Logging can be effectively used to track the state of an application. Debug 
logging works in conjunction with the emulator or simulator to create a file on 
your computer containing output from your OrbC application. Logging code is 
not generated for non-debug builds.</p>
<p>To write a line to the log, use the <code>debuglog</code> keyword:</p>
<pre>void myButton.onselect() {
  <b>debuglog</b>("myButton pressed, myCheckbox.checked=" + myCheckbox.checked);
}</pre>
<p>When the first <code>debuglog</code> statement is encountered, the file &quot;\orbforms_log.txt&quot; 
is opened in the root of the drive that was used to launch the emulator. Each <code>debuglog</code> 
statement creates a new line in the log file.</p>
<h3>Debug-only Code Blocks</h3>

<p>In addition to logging and assertions, you can create blocks of code that are 
only compiled into debug builds. To do this, create a block using the <code>debug</code> 
keyword. In the following example, a status label is used for verbose data:</p>
<pre>void loadData(Stream* stream) {
  Rectangle rect;
  int count, i;
  count = stream->readInt();
  for (i=0; i&lt;count; i++) {
    stream->read(&rect, typeof(rect), 1);
    <b>debug</b> {
      // display in a status label how many rects have been read
      // (this info it too verbose for end users, so do not
      // show this in non-debug builds)
      labelStatus.text = i + " rects";
    }
  }
}</pre>
<h3>Runtime Functions</h3>
<p>The following functions can be very useful in debugging. These are available 
in debug builds and non-debug builds.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="mcallstack.html">callstack()</a> - retreives the current call 
  stack.</li>
  <li><a href="mfatal.html">fatal()</a> - displays a fatal error and exits.</li>
</ul>
