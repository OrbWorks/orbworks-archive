<p>A native struct can be implemented in many ways. The documentation below
explains the model that the OrbC native interface supports through its
helper functions. In addition to the text below, it would be informative to read
through the sample add-ins. The SampleAddIn (samples\Add-ins\SampleAddIn)
implements SampleSerial, a native struct that demonstrates accessing the serial
port.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Currently native objects are not supported. What were previously 
called native objects are actually native structs. All the previous features are 
still supported, but with the current version of the compiler a struct must be 
used (because inheritance and virtual methods are not supported).</p>
<h3>Native Struct IDs</h3>
<p>Each native struct in the application has a unique id. This id is stored in
an internal table which maps it to a native struct pointer. In the OrbC
declaration, the struct defines only one field: this id - all other state and data of the struct are 
retrieved and set through properties and methods. To make coding easy, the
OrbC native interface provides a function (<code>nobj_pop</code>) to pop the 
struct pointer from the stack, dereference it to retrieve the id, and map the id to the
native struct pointer.</p>
<h3>Reference Counting</h3>
<p>Native structs are reference counted by the runtime environment. When a 
struct is created or copied, its reference count is increased automatically. 
When a struct goes out of scope or is deleted, the reference count is
decremented. When the reference count reaches zero, the native struct's delete
function is called. To support this reference counting mechanism, your native
struct must declare a <code> _copy</code> method and a <code> _destroy</code> method that call the built in
functions (80 and 89) as specified below:</p>
<pre>struct Native {
  int id;
  void _init() @ library(&quot;AddInName&quot;, 0);
  void _destroy() @ 80;
  void _copy(Native) @ 89;
}</pre>
<p>In addition to the reference counting handled by the runtime, you may add
explicit references to a struct. A common reason to do this is to ensure that
the lifetime of a container struct is greater than the lifetime of a struct it
owns. For example, a database owns the database records, so the database struct must live longer than the record. To ensure this, the database record 
struct adds an explicit reference to the database struct when it is created, and
removes the reference when it is destroyed.</p>
<p>Another advantage to using the ref-counted native structs is that the runtime
environment will be able to clean up all resources that the application
neglected, even if the application is stopping due to an error.</p>
<h3>Creating a Native Struct</h3>
<p>To create a native struct, you must allocate the state needed by the struct and call the supplied OrbC native interface function <code>nobj_create</code>
from your struct's <code>_init</code> method. This function pops the struct's
pointer from the stack, so you must NOT do this before hand. As a parameter to <code>nobj_create</code>,
you must specify the native struct's delete function. This function will be
called automatically by the runtime when the struct's reference count reaches 0.</p>
