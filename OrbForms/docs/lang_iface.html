<p>An interface is a way of specifying how to interact with an object without 
needing to know the type of the object. An interface allows otherwise unrelated 
object to expose a common set of methods. For example, both an orchestra and a 
CD player can play a song. However, there is little similarity otherwise and 
these objects should not derive from a common base object. The solution it to 
have these objects implement a common interface.</p>
<h3>Declaring an interface</h3>
<p>An interface is declared with the <code>interface</code> keyword and looks 
similar to an object declaration. An interface contains a list of methods, but 
cannot have member variables. An interface can inherit from other interfaces. 
All methods in an interface are virtual. Each object that claims to implement an 
interface must provide an implementation for each method that is part of the 
interface. For example:</p>
<pre>interface ISongPlayer {
  void playSong();
};
// an interface cannot have an implementation

object CDPlayer : ISongPlayer {
  void eject();
  void playSong();
};
void CDPlayer.eject() { alert("ejecting CD"); }
// provide an implementation for the ISongPlayer method
void CDPlayer.playSong() { alert("playing a CD track"); }

object Orchestra : ISongPlayer {
  void playSong();
  void practice();
};
// provide an implementation for the ISongPlayer method
void Orchestra.playSong() { alert("playing lots of instruments"); }
void Orchestra.practice() { alert("practicing"); }
</pre>
<p>In this example the ISongPlayer interface represents the commonality between 
the Orchestra and CDPlayer, specifically the ability to play a song. The 
CDPlayer and Orchestra each have other functionality as well.</p>
<h3>Using an interface</h3>
<p>An interface must be used through a pointer. Because an interface does not 
represent any specific object, an interface cannot be instantiated directly. An 
interface is used just like a pointer to an object, but the interface pointer 
can only be used to call methods defined on that interface (plus any of the base 
interfaces that the interface inherits from). For example:</p>
<pre>void PlayASong(ISongPlayer* player) {
  player->playSong(); // call a method on the interface
}

void Concert() {
  Orchestra orchestra;
  orchestra.practice();
  // because Orchestra implements the ISongPlayer interface, we can
  // pass a pointer to the orchestra to PlayASong, which is expecting
  // an ISongPlayer pointer
  PlayASong(&orchestra);
}</pre>
