<p>Legacy PocketC applications can be compiled with PocketC Architect with very 
few changes. This page lists the changes in the compiler and runtime that are 
incompatible with legacy PocketC applications. At the bottom of the page is a 
short list of the most common compiler errors during the porting process, and 
how to fix them.</p>
<h3>Deprecated Functions</h3>
<p>The following functions are no longer supported:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>malloc</i> - use <code><a href="mmalloct.html">malloct</a></code> or the <code>new</code> operator.</li>
  <li><i>settype</i> - types can no longer be changed at runtime, use <code>
  <a href="mmalloct.html">malloct</a></code> instead.</li>
  <li><i>typeof</i> - types can no longer be changed at runtime. <code>typeof</code> is 
  a keyword in OrbC.</li>
  <li><i>seropen</i> - use PocketC's <code>seropenx</code>, or convert to using 
  the <a href="oSerial.html">Serial</a> object.</li>
  <li><i>unpack</i> - instead of reading into a byte array and unpacking it, use 
  <code><a href="mSerial-recv.html">Serial.recv</a></code> or <code><a href="mSerialStream-read.html">SerialStream.read</a></code> to read the bytes in the intended format.</li>
  <li><i>deepsleep</i> - no equivalent.</li>
  <li><i>dbmovecat</i> - no equivalent.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Changed Functions</h3>
<p>The following functions have changed either their signatures or behaviors:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>event</i> - this function has been renamed to <code>pcevent</code>.</li>
  <li><i>malloct</i> - the parameters have been reversed.</li>
  <li><i>mathlib</i> - this function always returns 1. All math functions that require 
  MathLib will cause a runtime error rather than returning an invalid result as 
	they did in PocketC.</li>
  <li><i>memcpy</i> - this function now requires that the source and destination have 
  the same memory types. In PocketC, this function would change the memory type 
  at the destination to match the source.</li>
  <li><i>tone</i> - a volume parameter has been added</li>
  <li><i>seropenx</i> and other serial functions - return true for success and false 
  for failure, rather than 0 for success and an error code on error.</li>
</ul>
<h3>All or Nothing Conversions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Old graphics APIs (such as <code>graph_on</code>, <code>rect</code>) cannot be used in the same 
  application as the Draw object.</li>
  <li>Event handlers (and therefore the new UI) cannot be used in the same 
  application as the PocketC eventing functions (such as <code>pcevent</code>, <code>wait</code>).</li>
  <li><code>atexit</code> cannot be used in an application with event handlers. 
	Use the app onstop event instead.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Native Libraries</h3>
<p>Any new native code should be written as an OrbC native add-in. However, 
native libraries are supported with a few limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The native library interface function <code>callBI</code> only supports 
  the following functions - <code>graph_on</code>, <code>hookmenu</code>, <code>
  hooksilk</code>, <code>event</code>, <code>malloc</code>, and <code>textattr</code>.</li>
  <li>Native libraries can take pointer parameters, but cannot call <code>deref</code> 
  on non-parameters unless they are global values.</li>
  <li>To pass a function address to <code>Fctl </code>when using PToolboxLib, 
  first cast it to a <code>pointer</code>.</li>
	<li>Several PToolboxLib functions are not yet compatible with the OrbC 
	runtime, and will cause unexpected behavior or crashes.</li>
</ul>
<p>For native library developers, do the following things to ensure that your 
library runs correctly:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Use the extended APIs to deal will strings. DO NOT use the old 
	lockString/unlockString. DO NOT use your own code for directly manipulating 
	strings. See the original PocketC native library document for details. 
	Strings that are pushed and popped to be handled as they always have.</li>
	<li>In you library's open function (where you allocate the global memory 
	block), set the reserved field to 0x12345678 to inform the OrbC runtime that 
	your library will not try to access strings manually.</li>
	<li>When calling deref(), never increment/decrement the pointer that is 
	returned. In PocketC, this usually worked. In OrbC, this is not valid. Call 
	deref() for each value you need to access.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Issues/Differences</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Older versions of CControls had bugs which made them incompatible with the 
  OrbC runtime. Only the version of CControls which is included with PocketC 
  Architect can be used.</li>
  <li>In an application that uses the output form or graphics form (rather than 
  the new UI), when the <code>main</code> function exits, the application 
  remains on the final form it was on. In order to go back to the application 
  launcher, call <code>exit</code>.</li>
  <li>Macros which contain other macros are now implemented properly</li>
  <li>Function pointers in OrbC do not require a dereference. PocketC-style 
  function pointer still require a dereference for compatibility.</li>
  <li><code>&amp;array</code> is no longer valid. Instead, used <code>array</code> 
  or <code>&amp;array[0]</code>.</li>
  <li><code>@bmp</code>, <code>@res</code>, and the PRC properties are no longer 
  supported. Instead, use the new OrbC resource syntax.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Common Compiler Errors</h3>
<p>In porting your legacy PocketC application to OrbC, there are several common 
errors you may encounter:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>expected resource type</i> - this is most commonly caused by the 
  presence of one of the unsupported PRC properties, such as <code>@bmp</code> 
  or <code>@licon1</code>.</li>
  <li><i>cannot call a non-funcptr type</i> - this is most commonly caused by an 
  attempt to call the PocketC <code>event()</code> function. In OrbC, call <code>pcevent()</code> instead.</li>
</ul>
