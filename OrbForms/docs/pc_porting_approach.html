<p>Porting an application from PocketC to PocketC Architect is generally simple, 
and can be done in several phases. You can get your application running by only 
performing the first porting phase. To take full advantage of the new features 
and improved performance of the OrbC runtime, you may need to do a full 
conversion, as described below.</p>
<h3>Phase 1: Compiling a Legacy PocketC Application</h3>
<p>The first and easiest step is simply getting your application to compile. The 
PocketC Architect requires you to specify a few properties of the application in 
an @app block. The only required @app properties are creator, name, and dbname. 
For example:</p>
<pre>@app {
  creator = "MyAp"; // same as PocketC's @cid
  name = "App Name"; // display name, same as PocketC's @name
  dbname = "AppName-MyAp"; // name of .prc database, same as PocketC's @dbname
}</pre>
<p>Second, you must include the PocketC compatibility headers. The OrbC runtime 
has a richer, object-oriented API, and doesn't support the PocketC APIs by 
default. In order to use the PocketC APIs, you must include the appropriate 
header files which implement the APIs you intend to use. The easiest way to 
start is to just include &quot;pc_most.oc&quot;, which contains all of the PocketC APIs 
except those that require native add-ins. This is sufficient for most 
applications.</p>
<pre>#include &quot;pc_most.oc&quot;</pre>
<p>The following table lists all the compatibility headers:</p>
<table border="0" width="100%" id="table1" cellpadding="2">
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#E0E0E0">pc_most.oc</td>
    <td>Includes all headers except those that would require a native add-in to 
    be installed. Most applications should just use this header.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#E0E0E0">pc_all.oc</td>
    <td>Includes all headers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#E0E0E0">pc_io.oc</td>
    <td>Implements the Basic I/O functions (e.g. puts, gets, clear).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#E0E0E0">pc_events.oc</td>
    <td>Implements the event functions (e.g. pcevent, key, wait).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#E0E0E0">pc_string.oc</td>
    <td>Implements the string functions (e.g. strlwr, strtok).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#E0E0E0">pc_math.oc</td>
    <td>Implements the mathlib function.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#E0E0E0">pc_graphics.oc</td>
    <td>Implements the graphics functionns (e.g. graph_on, rect, bucreate).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#E0E0E0">pc_sound.oc</td>
    <td>Implements getvol.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#E0E0E0">pc_date.oc</td>
    <td>Implements the time and date functions (e.g. time, date).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#E0E0E0">pc_database.oc</td>
    <td>Implements the database functions (e.g. dbopen, dbcreate).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#E0E0E0">pc_memo.oc</td>
    <td>Implements the memo functions (e.g. mmnew).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#E0E0E0">pc_serial.oc</td>
    <td>Implements the serial port functions (e.g. seropenx). OrbSerial native 
    add-in is required if this header is included. This header is not included 
    by pc_most.oc.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#E0E0E0">pc_system.oc</td>
    <td>Implements the system functions (e.g. clipget, getsysval).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#E0E0E0">pc_memory.oc</td>
    <td>Implements the memory functions.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#E0E0E0">pc_network.oc</td>
    <td>Implements the network functions (e.g. netopen, sockopen). OrbNetwork 
    native add-in is required if this header is included. This header is not 
    included by pc_most.oc.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#E0E0E0">pc_vfs.oc</td>
    <td>Implements the VFS functions (e.g. fileread, filewrite). OrbVFS native 
    add-in is required if this header is included. This header is not included 
    by pc_most.oc.</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
<p>Once the correct headers are included, there are three primary changes that 
must be made because of conflicts between the OrbC runtime and PocketC.</p>
<ul>
  <li>All calls to event() must be replaced with calls to pcevent(). The OrbC 
  runtime uses a global event struct named &quot;event&quot; which conflicts with the old 
  function name.</li>
  <li>All calls to malloct() must have their parameters reversed. The type must 
  be the first parameter, and the count must be the second.</li>
  <li>Any use of CControls must be replaced by the version of CControls which 
  ships with PocketC Architect. This version contains the two changes mentioned 
  above as well as several fixes for bugs that just happened to work on PocketC even 
  though the code was incorrect.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase 2: Convert to the New UI, Eventing, and Drawing Model</h3>
<p>Using the new UI and eventing model makes programming new application much 
easier, and provides many benefits for existing applications. The most important 
benefit is that the new UI model uses native forms and controls, making 
applications much faster and more responsive to users. Another notable benefit 
is that forms and controls using the new UI model can automatically resize on 
devices with wide/tall screens without writing any code.</p>
<p>The new UI model, eventing model, and drawing model are not compatible with 
the old models. If you convert one of your forms from e.g. CControls, you must 
convert all of your forms, use only the new eventing model (no more pcevent(), key(), 
or similar 
calls), and use only the Draw methods (Draw.rect() instead of the rect() 
function). The reverse is also true, you cannot use the new eventing model if 
you are using the old graphics APIs (such as graph_on).</p>
<p>This phase is optional and straightforward, but may take considerable time. 
There are three basic steps involved:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Recreate the forms using the OrbC resource syntax, removing the old code 
  that would generate the forms.</li>
  <li>Create an onopen handler for your form's initialization code.</li>
  <li>Remove the old event loop, and replace it with form and control event 
  handlers.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase 3: Convert to the Object-Oriented APIs</h3>
<p>Finally, you can convert from the old PocketC APIs to the new object-oriented 
APIs. In many cases, the old APIs implemented in the PocketC compatibility 
headers are just thin wrappers around the new APIs. There are two primary 
advantages to using the new APIs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Improved performance - by not calling through wrappers (some of which are 
  more complicated than others, like the database APIs), you can gain 
  significant performance improvements. Some of the new APIs are much faster 
  than the original PocketC counterparts. For example, PocketC database APIs 
  always closed and re-opened databases between calls for safety, where the OrbC 
  runtime does not need to.</li>
  <li>Advanced functionality - many of the new APIs are richer than the old 
  APIs. For example, the new database APIs allow multiple records and databases 
  to be accessed simultaneously. See <a href="tAPINotes.html">API Conversion 
	Notes</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>
