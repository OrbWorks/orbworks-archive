<p>Much of the legacy PocketC APIs maps easily to the new object-oriented APIs. 
However, it may be helpful to cover a few specific categories.</p>
<h3>Graphics</h3>
<p>In legacy PocketC, graphics were created by drawing directly to the screen, 
generally after opening the graphics form by calling <code>graph_on()</code>. 
Although easy to use, this mechanism results in global graphics state that 
doesn't fit nicely in a structured application, and doesn't work well with gadgets. 
The approach taken in OrbC is to draw using a <a href="oDraw.html">Draw</a> 
object. A Draw object is used to draw to either a form, a gadget, or an 
offscreen buffer. Drawing to a Draw object must be done between calls to begin 
and end.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The drawing primitives and color functions map almost exactly to Draw 
  methods. The meanings of some of the color values have changed.</li>
  <li><code>bitmap</code> is not directly supported - embed your bitmaps using 
  the bitmap resource syntax instead.</li>
  <li>Offscreen buffers are now just Draw objects. Use the <code>draw</code> method to copy 
  between them.</li>
  <li>Resource bitmaps are not directly supported - embed your bitmaps using the 
  bitmap resource syntax instead.</li>
  <li><code>graph_on</code> and <code>graph_off</code> are no longer required, 
  just attach the Draw object to the current form.</li>
  <li><code>pushdraw</code> and <code>popdraw</code> are equivalent to calling <code>begin</code> 
  and <code>end</code>.</li>
  <li><code>saveg</code> and <code>restoreg</code> can be done by copying a form 
  using <code>copyForm</code>.</li>
  <li>Screen attributes and color depth are available on the
  <a href="oUIApp.html">application</a> object.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Events</h3>
<p>The eventing model in OrbC is substantially different that legacy PocketC. 
The most important difference is that your application doesn't have an event 
loop at all. Instead, you implement handlers for form and control events.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pen events are available on forms and gadgets</li>
  <li>Event data returned by functions such as <code>key</code> or <code>penx</code> 
  is now available within event handlers in the global <a href="oEvent.html">
  Event</a> structure.</li>
  <li>The functions that wait for events such as <code>waitp</code> or <code>getc</code> 
  no longer apply.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Database</h3>
<p>The legacy PocketC functions always operated on the current database and 
record. In OrbC, multiple databases and records can be opened at once. </p>
<ul>
  <li>The legacy functions map to methods on either <a href="oDatabase.html">
  Database</a>, <a href="oDBRecord.html">DBRecord</a>, or
  <a href="oDatabaseMgr.html">DatabaseMgr</a>.</li>
  <li>The format used by OrbC read/write methods is slightly different than 
  those used by <code>dbreadx</code> and <code>dbwritex</code>. See
  <a href="tTypeStrings.html">type strings</a> for details.</li>
</ul>
