<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>To start building and executing applications, you must do the following
simple tasks:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Install OrbForms Designer</b> - If you are reading this, you have
    probably done already installed OrbForms Designer.</li>
  <li><b>Download and Install Palm OS Emulator</b> - Download the Palm OS
  Emulator from Palm's development site - <a href="http://www.palmos.com/dev/tools/emulator/" target="_blank">get
    it here</a>. Install it according the the instructions it provides. Either
    download a ROM image (requires signing an agreement with Palm), or copy the
    ROM from your Palm device by following the provided instructions. Using the
    emulator is not strictly required, but make development much faster (the
    emulator IS required when using the OrbForms Designer demo version).</li>
  <li><b>Install OrbForms Runtime</b> - Copy OrbFormsRT.prc and Mathlib.prc to
    your device/emulator. OrbFormsRT.prc is the OrbForms runtime engine - this
    is not required if you build a standalone application. Mathlib.prc is a
    standard mathematics library than many Palm OS applications use, and is
    included in the ROM of some handhelds, such as Handspring devices.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Making a program using OrbForms Designer</h3>
<p>If you're new to Palm programming, try creating a small application to get 
the feel for how everything works. OrbForms Designer comes 
equipped with tutorials to provide a quick and easy way to experience Palm 
programming while learning the features and power of the OrbForms Designer tool.</p>
<p>The basic steps for making a program are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b> Create a project</b>. Using the OrbForms Designer project wizard,
    create a project. A project 
allows you to manage and organize all the source files that are part of the 
application. It also maintains the user interface you design with the visual
    designer.</li>
  <li><b>Design the forms</b>. By default, a project will create an empty form. 
You need to customize the form's appearance using the visual design tool within OrbForms
    Designer. You can also add additional forms, menus, bitmaps, and help
    strings.</li>
  <li><b> Add customized code</b>. With the layout of the form complete, you now provide customized handlers for
    events. An event occurs any time the user does something to your
    application, such as tapping a button or selecting a menu item.</li>
  <li><b> Compile the project</b>. When you're ready to see the results of your efforts, 
compile the project into the finished Palm application.</li>
  <li><b> Test the application</b>. To make sure the application looks and acts the way you 
planned, you need to test it. Testing can be as simple as copying the 
program to your Palm device or the Palm OS Emulator. 
If you find problems, resolve them in the source files and compile the project
    again. For the demo version of OrbForms Designer, the compiled applications
    are only allowed to run on the emulator.</li>
  <li><b> Deliver the final Palm application</b>. When you're satisfied with the way your 
Palm application looks and acts, you make it available to others who may find 
your program useful. That may mean sending the Palm application you 
created to others through email, floppy disks, or simply beam it over to another 
Palm device. Another popular method is to put on the internet for others 
to download to their devices.</li>
</ul>
