<p>In this lesson you will walk through creating a survey application, which
will demonstrate using more than one form, using the Preferences object, and
reading and writing application data to a database. </p>
<p>While going through this lesson, it would be best to have the sample
application open for reference. </p>
<h3>Survey Application Requirements </h3>
<p>The application will need to do the following things: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a database of people, one record per person</li>
  <li>Store basic personal and work information about each person</li>
  <li>Allow new records to be added</li>
  <li>Allow existing records to be edited</li>
  <li>Restore the previous state each time the application is executed</li>
</ul>
<p>To meet these requirements, we create a new &quot;basic&quot; application
using the new project wizard. We create two forms, one for personal information,
and a second for work information. We also create a record manager object
to simplify storing and retrieving records. Finally, we add code to save data
from each form, and load the data into the form. </p>
<h3>Data Structures </h3>
<p>Only a few data structures are needed for this application. First, we need
the application preferences, which will be used to store the current state of
the application. The state of our application is really just two variables - the
current page that is being view (either personal or work), and the current
record being edited. We will use the AppPrefs struct created by the project
wizard, and redefine it as follows. We also want to define an enum to make our
source code easier to read. </p>
<pre>enum { PAGE_PERSONAL, PAGE_WORK };

struct AppPrefs {
  int iRecord; // the current record
  int iPage; // the current page
};</pre>
<p>We also want to have a data structure to represent the data in each database
entry. We will split it up into two structures - one for each page, and define a
few more enums for easy coding: </p>
<pre>enum { SEX_MALE, SEX_FEMALE };
enum { STATUS_SINGLE, STATUS_MARRIED, STATUS_DIVORCED };

struct PersonalData {
  string name;
  int age;
  int sex;
  int status;
};

struct WorkData {
  string employer;
  string position;
  int years;
  int distance;
};

struct Entry {
  PersonalData per;
  WorkData work;
};</pre>
<p>We create a single global preferences variable, and a single global Entry to
represent the current record. When we read from and write to the database, we
will use this variable. </p>
<pre>AppPrefs appPrefs;
Entry entry;</pre>

<h3>Information Collection Forms</h3>
<p>We need two forms, one for personal information and one for work
information. Open the sample project to see what these should look like. Each
form has a field, push button, or popup and list for each piece of information that we want to
collect. Each form also has an identical set of buttons and a label at
the bottom for navigating the database. We will create a record manager to take
care of the database operations and updating the display of those form controls.
On the top of each form is a popup showing which form is currently open, and
allows the user to switch between the forms.</p>
<h3>Record Manager</h3>
<p><b>Reading and Writing</b></p>
<p>We have created a record manager to read from and write to records in the
database. There are three core methods in the RecordManager - readRecord,
writeRecord, and addRecord. Each of these methods are similar, so we will focus
on the readRecord method:</p>
<pre>bool RecordManager.readRecord() {
  // read the current record from the database
  Database db;
  DBRecord rec;
  bool bRet = false;
  
  // open the database
  if (db.open(&quot;SurveyData&quot;, false)) {
    if (db.getrec(appPrefs.iRecord, rec, true)) {
      rec.read(&amp;entry, typeof(entry), 1);
      rec.close();
      nRecords = db.nrecs;
      bRet = true;
    }
    db.close();
  }
  return bRet;
}</pre>
<p>We need three local variables to read a record from the database - a Database
object which will allow us to interact with the database, a DBRecord object
which allows us to read and write the record within the database, and a bool
return variable which we will use to store whether or not we succeeded. If the
function fails we return false, which is important in the init method because we
will create a new database if we were unable to find one. </p>
<p>The first step is to attempt to open the database, using the Database.open
method. If that succeeds, we try to get the current record - appPrefs.iRecord is
the record that is currently being viewed. The Database.getrec method attaches
rec, our DBRecord variable, to the requested database record. </p>
<p>Once we get the record we want, we need to read it into our global entry
variable. DBRecord.read takes three parameters - a pointer to the data structure
we want to read into, a type string provided by the typeof operator, and the
number of data structures to read. Since we are only storing one database entry
per record, we can only specify 1 for the last parameter. </p>
<p>Finally we close the record and then the database. It is important that they
be closed in the correct order! </p>
<p><b>Switching Records</b> </p>
<p>The record manager also provides methods for switching between records via
the next, prev, and add methods. These methods are very simple, doing four
things: </p>
<ol>
  <li>call the writeRecord method mentioned earlier to save the current entry</li>
  <li>update the record number in appPrefs.iRecord</li>
  <li>call the readRecord to load the newly selected record</li>
  <li>update the display</li>
</ol>
<p>RecordManager.next, for example, looks like this:</p>
<pre>void RecordManager.next() {
  // go to the next record
  writeRecord();
  appPrefs.iRecord++;
  readRecord();
  updateDisplay();
}</pre>
<p>Updating the display is the interesting part. To allow the record manager to
update the info at the bottom of both the personal form and the work form
(whichever is currently active), we actually store a reference to the controls
that need updated. When one of the forms opens, it calls
RecordManager.setControls, passing the label object and the two button objects
as parameters.
In the updateDisplay method (called by next, prev, and add), we set the label's
text to state the current record and the total number of records. We also hide
the next and previous buttons if they can't be used (you can't press the
previous button if you are already at the first record).</p>
<pre>void RecordManager.updateDisplay() {
  // show/hide the buttons when not applicable
  btnPrev.visible = appPrefs.iRecord &gt; 0;
  btnNext.visible = appPrefs.iRecord &lt; nRecords - 1;
  label.text = &quot;Record &quot; + (appPrefs.iRecord + 1) + &quot; of &quot; + nRecords;
}</pre>
<h3>Form Implementation </h3>
<p>Each form represents a portion of the data in a record. In order to display
and edit the data, we must create functions to fill the controls with the data
in the current record, and to save the data from the controls back into the
record. We will walk through the savePersonalData function now. </p>
<p>There are three
types of controls on the form: two fields, two pushbuttons, and a popup/list.
Getting data from each control is a little different. The contents of a field is
retrieved using the text property, and can be assigned directly into our
varaible. A pushbutton can either be checked (appearing to be pressed) or not.
Since only one pushbutton in a group can be checked, we can set the sex entry to
0 if the male pushbutton is checked, and 1 otherwise since the female button
would be checked if male was not. The popup/list selection is retrieved from the
list object - even when the list is not popped up you can query for its selected
item. The index of the selected item matches the values in the STATUS_ enums, so
we assign the selitems property directly to the status field. </p>
<pre>void savePersonalData() {
  // save the data from the form into the current record
  entry.per.name = fldPersonalName.text;
  entry.per.age = fldPersonalAge.text;
  if (pushMale.checked) {
    entry.per.sex = 0;
  } else {
    entry.per.sex = 1;
  }
  entry.per.status = listPersonalStatus.selitem;
}</pre>
<p>The basis of an OrbForms application are the event handlers. The primary
handlers of the forms are the onopen and onclose handlers. The onclose handler simply
calls savePersonalData to save any controls that may have been modified. The
more interesting code resides in the onopen handler. Since the contents of lists
must be set at runtime, this is the location where we do it. Setting the items
in the list is straight forward, as illustrated below (just pass in an array of
strings). One thing that is less obvious is that setting the selected item in
the list does not change the text of the popop control - this must be done
manually. </p>
<p>Once the lists and popups are setup, we load the data from the current record
and then call into the record manager to tell it which controls it should be
updating. </p>
<pre>handler personalForm.onopen() {
  string pages[2] = { &quot;Personal&quot;, &quot;Work&quot; };
  string status[3] = { &quot;Single&quot;, &quot;Married&quot;, &quot;Divorced&quot; };

  // setup the form popup
  listPersonalPages.setitems(2, pages);
  listPersonalPages.selitem = 0;
  popPersonalPage.text = &quot;Personal&quot;;

  // setup the status popup
  listPersonalStatus.setitems(3, status);
  
  loadPersonalData();
  
  // setup the record manager to modify the controls
  // on this form
  recMgr.setControls(lblPersonalRecord, btnPersonalPrevious, btnPersonalNext);
}</pre>
<p>All of the other work that we have done makes it extremely easy to implement
the handlers for the next and previous buttons. All that needs to be done is to
save the data in the current form, call the appropriate record manager method,
and load the new data: </p>
<pre>handler btnPersonalNext.onselect() {
  savePersonalData();
  recMgr.next();
  loadPersonalData();
}</pre>
<p>In order to switch forms when the user selects a page from the upper-right
popup, we implement a handler for the popup's onlistselect event. There are
actually two ways that popups can be implemented. Either you can create a
handler for the onselect event in which you call the list's popup method - this
is best if the contents of the list are not known ahead of time - or you can
create a handler for the onlistselect event. If you create an onlistselect
handler, the OS will take care of displaying the list for you. </p>
<pre>handler popPersonalPage.onlistselect() {
  if (event.value == 1) {
    workForm.load();
    appPrefs.iPage = PAGE_WORK;
  }
}</pre>
<h3>Application Handlers </h3>
<p>The application handlers are the place where we want to load and store the
preferences - which record is currently selected and which page is being viewed.
The method for reading preferences is similar to the Database.read function. The
last three parameters are the same - a pointer to memory to load the preference into, a
type string, and a count. The first parameter specifies the creator id of the
application - when you create your project with the basic project wizard, the
creator id is put there for you. The second parameter specifies if this is a
saved preference. A saved preference is one that is backed up to your desktop
when you sync, a non-saved preference is lost when the device is reset.</p>
<pre>handler app.onstart() {
  Preferences prefs;
  // load the preferences
  prefs.get(&quot;Srvy&quot;, false, &amp;appPrefs, typeof(appPrefs), 1);</pre>
<p>We choose which form to first load based on the stored preferences. From onstart:</p>
<pre>  // load the previously viewed form
  switch (appPrefs.iPage) {
    default:
    case PAGE_PERSONAL:
      personalForm.load();
      break;
    case PAGE_WORK:
      workForm.load();
      break;
  }</pre>
<h3>Conclusion </h3>
<p>We have demonstrated a fairly complete application that, although a bit
contrived, would form a good basis for a real survey application or database
application. Through this application we have also had the chance to look at
some key elements of the runtime - databases, and preferences. </p>
