<p>Native gadgets are an easy way to create rich, responsive user
interfaces. The following documentation explains the rules for creating them,
but reading the sample code will be extremely useful. The SampleAddIn
(samples\Add-ins\SampleAddIn) implements a native gadget called the TargetGadget.
The NativeGadget sample uses this gadget.</p>
<h3>Native Gadget IDs</h3>
<p>Gadgets are implemented as structs in OrbC, so the methods of a gadget
have the struct pointer as the first parameter. Similar to native structs, a
gadget implemented natively has a first field in OrbC memory which is its
id. Unlike a native struct, this id is based on the resource id of the Palm OS
control.</p>
<h3>Associated Data</h3>
<p>Each instance of a native gadget can have native data associated
with it. This data should be allocated in the onopen handler and set using the
OrbC native interface function <code>gadget_set_data</code>. For other
method calls, this data can be retrieved by popping the struct pointer,
dereferencing it to retrieve the id, and calling <code>gadget_get_data</code>.
The data should be freed in the onclose handler, and the data pointer should be
set to null.</p>
<h3>Drawing and Bounds</h3>
<p>When drawing in a gadget, the native code must honor the gadget's bounds
which are relative to the containing form. When a gadget's handler is called,
the active drawing window will be the form containing the gadget. In order to
draw in the gadget, you must add it's x and y coordinates to the points you plan to
draw (see the sample for an example). Optionally, you may want to set a clipping
rectangle to the location and size of the gadget to prevent accidentally
drawing on the form.</p>
<h3>Retrieving Event Data</h3>
<p>When the gadget's native handler is called, you may need to retrieve the
event data (such as event.x in OrbC code). To do this, call the Event struct's property method (find the index in orbc.sys). See the sample code
for an example.</p>
<h3>Calling Custom Event Handlers</h3>
<p>Custom event handlers are stored as code pointers in the gadget struct. The
handler is stored as an int which is 0 if the custom event is not handled by the
instance, or the address of the method if it is handled. If implemented, the
handler should be called by pushing the pointer to the gadget onto the stack
and using <code>vm_call</code> to call the method.</p>
<p>The location of the event handler's address is determined by the location of
the handler declaration. For example, if the gadget's first member is a UIGadget
(which is must be), and the second member is &quot;<code>handler customEvent</code>&quot;,
then the offset of the handler is 1. For example:</p>
<pre>struct NativeGadget {
  // the UIGadget is required to be the first field.
  // it contains one member, which is the resource id
  // of the gadget.
  UIGadget gadget; // location 0
  void someMethod(); // takes no space in the struct
  handler onCustomEvent; // location 1
  int state; // location 2;
};</pre>
