<p>A function is a group of statements which is the basic unit of a program. A function has a return type, may have
parameters, and may have local variables. The return type is the type (such as
<code>int</code>) of the value the function returns - when used in an expression, the body of
the function is executed and its return value is used as part of the expression.
(If a function does not return a value, its
type is <code>void</code>, and the function cannot be used in an expression.)<i><br/>
return-type func-name</i>([<i>param-type param-name</i>,...]) { <i>local-variables
statements</i> }</p>

<p>Function names follow the same rules as variable names - 1. the name must be 31
characters or less. 2. the name may only contain letters, numbers, and the
underscore character (_) 3. the name must not begin with a number. All function
names must be unique, and you may not declare a function with the same name as
one of the built-in functions.</p>
<p>Statements are discussed later, but for now, here are a few examples:</p>
<pre>int area(int width, int height) {
   return width * height;
}

float square(float x) {
   return x * x;
}

int five() {
   return 5;
}

void sayHello() {
   alert(&quot;Hello&quot;);
}</pre>

<p><b>Local variables</b> are variables that can only be seen inside a function.
In fact, they only exist while the function is executing. In other words,
function A cannot access the variable inside of function B, and vice versa. When
a function returns, the memory used by the local variables is cleaned up, and
they are no longer accessible. This leads to the
topic of <b>variable scope</b>. All variables have a scope - either global,
local, or struct/object member. You can define a local variable (or parameter)
with the same name as a global variable - when using the variable name inside the function, the local
variable will be accessed/modified, but the global variable will be
inaccessible.</p>
<p><b>Parameters</b> are local variables whose value is provided by the calling
function. In the function above, <code>area</code>, there are two parameters - <code>width</code> and
<code>height</code>. <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are local variables, but there value is initialized
elsewhere. To invoke area with a width of 5 and a height of 4, you would
type:</p>

<pre>area(5, 4);</pre>

<p>Parameters (except struct and object parameters) are passed by value, which
means that if you pass a variable into a function as a parameter, the function
is not able to modify the original variables. For example:</p>

<pre>void six(int x) {
  x = 6; // only sets the local variable
}

void test() {
  int y = 9;
  six(y);
  // y is still 9
}</pre>

<p>Structs and objects, however, are passed by reference. We'll discuss these
later.</p>
