<p>A type string is a way of describing the structure of data. Several API
					functions use type strings to control how data is read and written, such
					as <a href="mPreferences-get.html">Preferences.get</a>. The
					easiest way to generate a type string is to use the <code>typeof()</code>
					operator, which generates a correct type string for any object/data type.
					However, sometimes it is necessary to create type strings by hand in order
					to interoperate with the data formats of other applications.
					</p>
					<p>A type string consists of a list of characters representing primitive
					types, with
					optional modifier to specify repetition. The types are as follows:
					<table border="1">
						<tr><th>Specifier</th><th>Primitive Type</th></tr>
						<tr><td>i</td><td>int</td></tr>
						<tr><td>w</td><td>2-byte int</td></tr>
                        <tr>
                          <td>b</td><td>1-byte int</td>
                        </tr>
						<tr><td>c</td><td>char</td></tr>
						<tr><td>f</td><td>float</td></tr>
						<tr><td>s</td><td>string</td></tr>
						<tr>
                          <td>l</td><td>fixed-length string</td>
                        </tr>
						<tr><td>o</td><td>object type id</td></tr>
					</table>
					<b>Note:</b> When using a fixed-length string, the 'l' specifier must be
					followed with the length of the string followed by a dot '.'.
					<p>A specifier may be preceded by a number representing the number of
					repeated values of the type in a row.
					</p>
					<p>For example:
<pre>struct X {
  int x, y;
  string name;
  float f[4];
};</pre>
					The type string for X could be encoded as "iisffff" or "2is4f".
					<p>If name were required to be stored as a 32 character array:
<pre>struct X {
  int x, y;
  string name; // stored as a 32 character array
  float f[4];
};</pre>
					The type string for X could be encoded as "iil32.ffff" or "2il32.4f".<p>
The object type id is a location in memory at the start of an object that lets 
the runtime know what type of object is stored there. This value is skipped by 
the methods that take type strings (because writing out an object id is not 
possible). So, if the struct above was declared as an object:</p>
<pre>object X {
  int x, y;
  string name;
  float f[4];
};</pre>
					The type string for X could be encoded as "oiisffff" or "o2is4f".
