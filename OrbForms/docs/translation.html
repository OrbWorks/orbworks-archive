<p>OrbForms Designer makes it extremely easy to translate your application to 
multiple languages through its language file support. When a language file is 
selected in the application properties, the compiler will do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For each translatable string in the application (e.g. form titles, literal 
  strings in source code), the compiler will lookup the string in the language 
  file.</li>
<li>If the string exists in the language file and a translation is provided, the 
translated string will be used instead of the original.</li>
  <li>If the string does not exist in the language file, the compiler will add 
  it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Translating an Application</h3>
<p>To translate your application, follow the steps below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create an empty text file in your project folder (e.g. deutsch.txt)</li>
  <li>Add this language file to the project by right-clicking on &quot;Language Files&quot;
  from the source tree and selecting &quot;Add Language File&quot;.</li>
  <li>Specify the language file to use by selecting the application in the project
  tree and modifying the &quot;Language file&quot; property.</li>
  <li>Compile the application. This will fill the language file with all the 
  translatable strings from your application.</li>
  <li>Edit the language file in a text editor, adding translations where 
  appropriate.</li>
  <li>Compile the application again, and the translated strings will be used 
  instead of the originals.</li>
</ul>
<p>To translate to another language, repeat the steps above with a new language 
file. To build the original application (with no translation) change the 
application property to no longer use a language file.</p>
<h3>Language File Format</h3>
<p>A language file is a text file with a very simple format. Each string entry 
is four lines long with an empty line in the middle:</p>
<pre>// app display name
// user comment
"Application"
"Anwendung"</pre>
<p>The first line is a compiler-generated comment which specifies where the 
string was first encountered by the compiler (a given string will only show up 
once in the language file, no matter how many times it shows up in the 
application). This comment is regenerated each time the project is compiled. The 
second line is a user comment. Insert whatever you want here - the compiler will 
preserve it across compiles. The third line is the string to be translated. The 
fourth line is the translated string. If the translated string is empty (&quot;&quot;), 
the original string will be used.</p>
<p>As the application evolves, some strings may be removed from the application. 
These are not automatically removed from the language file. Instead, they are 
moved to the end of the file with the compiler comment set to &quot;unused&quot; for easy 
removal.</p>
