<p>A function pointer is a variable which contains the address of a function.
When the address of a function is assigned to such a variable, it can be used
just like the function. To use a function pointer, you must first declare a
function pointer type using the <code>funcptr</code> keyword.</p>

<pre>funcptr CallBack string(string, int);</pre>

<p>In the above declaration, a new type named <code>CallBack</code> is
declared. The second half of the declaration is the function signature, which
states that the
<code>CallBack</code> type can be used to point to any function which returns
an string, and takes a string and an int as its arguments. In order to use the
new type, you must declare a variable of that type and assign a matching
function address to it:</p>

<pre>string display(string str, int x) {
  return str + &quot; = &quot; + x;
}

CallBack cb;
cb = display;</pre>

<p>Once assigned, the function pointer can be used as if it were the function it
points to. The following two lines do the same thing:</p>

<pre>result = display(&quot;value&quot;, 5);
result = cb(&quot;value&quot;, 5);</pre>
