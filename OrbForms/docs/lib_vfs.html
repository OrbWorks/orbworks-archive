<p>The Palm OS support for Virtual File Systems (VFS) allows an application to
read and write files to removable storage, such as a compact flash card or
memory stick. OrbC support for VFS is provided by the OrbVFS native add-in.
To use it, you must add the line below to your application's source code. If
your application is not built standalone, you must also ensure that OrbVFS.prc
is installed on the device or emulator.
</p>
<pre>#include &quot;add-ins/OrbVFS.oc&quot;</pre>
<p>Each removable storage device contains
one or more volumes. To access a file, you must first retrieve the volume on
which it resides using <a href="mVolumeMgr-enumerate.html">VolumeMgr.enumerate()</a>.
This
method will enumerate all volumes on the device - if the device does not support
VFS, no volumes will be returned. Once you have retrieved the <a href="oVolume.html">Volume</a>
object, you can use it to create and open files and directories. To get a list
of all the files in a directory, first open the directory with <a href="mVolume-openDir.html">Volume.openDir()</a>,
then enumerate through the files and directories using <a href="mDirectory-enumerate.html">Directory.enumerate()</a>.
The get the files in the root directory, call <a href="mVolume-openDir.html">openDir(&quot;/&quot;)</a>.
</p>
<p>Unlike traditional operating systems, the Palm OS VFS support does not
support a concept of &quot;current directory&quot;. Instead, all paths are fully
specified for a given volume.
</p>
<p>The following error codes may be returned from the VFS methods:
