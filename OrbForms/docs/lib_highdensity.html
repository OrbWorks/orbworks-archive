<p>Beginning with version 5, the Palm OS supports screen resolutions higher than
160 by 160. OrbC provides support for these higher resolutions as
described below.</p>
<h3>Coordinates versus Pixels</h3>
<p>To maintain compatibility with older applications, the OS treats forms and
controls based on a 160 by 160 &quot;coordinates&quot;. The OS stretches them to
fit the actual resolution of the device - on a 320 by 320 device, one coordinate
represents a 2 by 2 block of pixels.</p>
<p>When creating forms and controls in OrbC, or when accessing
their x,y,w,h properties at runtime, 160 by 160 coordinates are used. Also, when
an older application draws to the screen, 160 by 160 coordinates are used and
stretched by the OS to match the resolution of the device.</p>
<h3>Bitmaps and Icons</h3>
<p>The easiest way to make an app look better on high-density devices is to
provide high-density versions of the app bitmaps and icons. To use these
high-density images, no application changes are required - the OS will
automatically display the high-density image on a supported device (older
devices will use the standard image instead).</p>
<p>To define a high-density bitmap or icon, create an additional .bmp file that is
exactly twice as wide and twice as tall as the standard image. Select the bitmap
or icon in the IDE and add the new .bmp file in the property inspector.</p>
<h3>Drawing </h3>
<p>When using the Draw object, the parameters passed to e.g. line() are
interpreted as 160 by 160 coordinates. This allows older applications (and
applications that don't care about the high density screen) to work without
modification.</p>
<p>To allow easy drawing on both high-density and standard devices (including
pre OS 5 devices), OrbC supports drawing at &quot;native&quot; resolution.
Native resolution will be 160 by 160 on older devices and may be higher (e.g.
320 by 320) on newer high density devices. To draw
in native resolution, an application should call Draw.nbegin() rather than
Draw.begin() and then use the graphics functions as usual. Once Draw.nbegin()
has been called, the native width and height of the drawing surface can be
retrieved using the Draw object's nw and nh properties. For example, a gadget
may draw like this:</p>
<pre>object MyGadget {
  UIGadget gadget;
  void onopen();
  void ondraw();
  Draw draw;
}
void MyGadget.onopen() {
  draw.attachGadget(gadget);
}
void MyGadget.ondraw() {
  // draw an X
  draw.nbegin();
  draw.line(clrFG, 0, 0, draw.nw, draw.nh);
  draw.line(clrFG, 0, draw.nh, draw.nw, 0);
  draw.end();
}</pre>
<h3>Pen Input</h3>
<p>To determine the location of a pen event in native pixels rather than
coordinates, two new properties have been added to the Event structure: nx
(native x) and ny (native y). </p>
<h3>Pre OS 5 Devices</h3>
<p>Although other Palm OS based devices added high resolution support before OS
5 (such as the Sony Clie and Handera), the API was not standardized. All future
versions of these devices will use the new standardized API. OrbC does not
currently support the non-standard APIs.</p>
