<p>An OrbC application responds to user interaction through event handlers.
Whenever a button is pressed, a form is opened, or dozens of other things
happen, an event is generated. If the application has defined a handler for that
event, that handler is executed.</p>
<p>For each user interface object (form, button, etc.) in your application, the
IDE automatically creates an object to represent it. Each type of control has a
corresponding object type - a button is of type UIButton, form is UIForm, etc.
See the API documentation for more details and supported events. For example,
if you created a button named 'helloButton', the compiler would create a
UIButton object named 'helloButton'.</p>

<p>An event handler is similar to an object method, but is defined for an
<i>instance</i> of a UI object. A handler does not have a return value, and takes no
parameters - the event information can be retrieved using the Event object, see
API documentation for details. When one of the events occurs that is supported
by the object, the handler is executed. Using 'helloButton' as an example, you
could define a handler for the onselect event (which is the only event supported
by a button) like this:</p>

<pre>handler helloButton.onselect() {
  alert(&quot;You pressed the 'hello' button!&quot;);
}</pre>

<p>Just as with object methods, event handlers can access the UI object's
members directly (like the x and y coordinate):</p>

<pre>handler helloButton.onselect() {
  string coord;
  coord = &quot;(&quot; + x + &quot;,&quot; + y + &quot;)&quot;; // x and y provided by UIButton object
  alert(&quot;helloButton is at &quot; + coord);
}</pre>

<p>Unlike object methods, handlers cannot be called directly - only the runtime
can call them.</p>
