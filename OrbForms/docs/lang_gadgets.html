<p>The Palm OS provides many useful types of UI controls, such as buttons, lists,
and text fields. However, many times an application needs to interact with the
user in a way these controls to do not provide. For example, a chart control
would be very useful for displaying collected data and a graph control would
make displaying trends easy. Using gadgets it is possible to create these and
many other controls that can then be reused in multiple forms or applications.</p>

<p>A gadget is defined by creating a struct which provides some or all the default
event handlers. A gadget must have a UIGadget as its first member, and must
define methods to handle one or more of the gadget events (onopen, onclose,
ondraw, onpendown, onpenmove, onpenup). These methods have the same name as the
event handler, take no parameters, and return nothing (<code>void</code>). For example:</p>

<pre>struct Chart {     // <b>NOTE:</b> As of version 3 this must be a struct
  UIGadget gadget; // rather than an object
  void onopen();
  void onclose();
  void ondraw();
  
  Draw draw;
};

void Chart.onopen() {
  draw.attachGadget(gadget); // a draw struct can attach to a gadget when it opens
}

void Chart.onclose() {
}

void Chart.ondraw() {
  draw.begin();
  draw.line(clrFG, 0, 0, gadget.w-1, gadget.h-1);
  draw.end();
}</pre>

<p>When these methods are defined, they are used as the default event handlers
for gadgets of this type. The UIGadget struct (called 'gadget' above) is used to
access the location, size, and visibility properties of the gadget (see ondraw
above). </p>

<p>To use a gadget, create an instance of one on a form using the IDE. After a
Chart gadget is added to a form, the IDE automatically creates a Chart struct
using the name you have specified, myChart for example. To customize this
struct, you may override the default handlers that the gadget type provides.
However, if you define a handler for myChart, the default handler will not be
called unless you explicitly call it. For example: </p>

<pre>handler myChart.ondraw() {
  ondraw(); // call the default Chart supplies
  draw.begin();
  draw.line(clrFG, gadget.w-1, 0, 0, gadget.h-1);// draw an intersecting line
  draw.end();
}</pre>
<h3>Custom Events</h3>
<p>It is often useful for a gadget to create its own events. For example, a
tic-tac-toe gadget could define an <i>onusermove</i> event that would fire when the
user clicked on the gadget in a valid position. Implementing custom events in
your gadget requires two steps. First, declare the event handler in your struct
using the <i>handler</i> keyword:</p>
<pre>struct TicGadget {
  // A UIGadget must always be the first member of a gadget
  UIGadget gadget;
  
  // default event handlers
  void onpenup();
  
  // custom events
  handler onusermove;
  
  // actions from app
  void newGame();
  ...</pre>
<p>Second, call the event handler. The event handler is called like a normal
function, however, if the user of the gadget has not defined a handler, the call
does nothing. Like other handlers, custom event handlers do not take arguments.
Unlike other handlers, a custom handler cannot pass event arguments in
the Event structure (since its properties are read-only). Instead, the data
needed by the event handler should
be member variables in your gadget struct.</p>
<pre>void TicGadget.onpenup() {
  if (isValidMove(event.x, event.y) {
    onusermove();
  }
}</pre>
<h3>Embedding Bitmaps in Your Gadget</h3>
<p>If your gadget uses bitmaps, it is useful to automatically include those in
the application without requiring the user to explicitly add them to the project. To do this,
add a bitmap declaration to your gadget declaration file. A bitmap declaration
looks like this:</p>
<pre>@bitmap Bitmap <i>yourBitmapName</i> {
  id = 2000
  image1 = &quot;gadget_bitmap_file_1.bmp&quot;
  image8 = &quot;gadget_bitmap_file_8.bmp&quot;
}</pre>
<p>As you can see, a bitmap declaration does not follow the same syntax rules as
other language elements. In particular, there is no semicolon a the end of the
block, nor are there any within the block. </p>
<p>The bitmap declaration contains two properties - the id and the image names.
The id is the resource id that will be used to store and reference the bitmap by
the OS. This id must not conflict with other bitmap ids in the application, so
you should choose a high number (but &lt;9000). The image files associated with
a bitmap are specified using the image<i>x</i> properties, where <i>x</i> is the
bit-depth - you may specify image1, image2, image4, image8, and/or image16.
High density images can also be specified using imageh1, imageh2, imageh4, imageh8,
and/or imageh16. You may specify any combination of bit-depths. All normal density images specified must be the same size;
high-density images must be exactly twice the size of normal images.</p>
