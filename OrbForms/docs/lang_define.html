<p>OrbC supports basic C-style compiler directives for conditional compilation. 
Conditional compilation allows you to have code in your source files that may or 
may not be compiled, based on defined symbols. OrbC also supports basic 
replacement macros.</p>
<h3>#define <i>symbol</i></h3>
<p>Defines a symbol for use with the conditional directives below.</p>
<pre>#define INTERNAL_BUILD</pre>
<h3>#define <i>symbol replacementText</i></h3>
<p>Defines a symbol for source code replacement. When the compiler comes across
<i>symbol</i> in a source file, it treats it as though it actually read<i> 
replacementText</i>.</p>
<pre>#define COLOR "green"
#define DIVIDEBY3 / 3

int x;
string func() {
  x = 12 DIVIDEBY3;
  return COLOR;
}
</pre>
<p>The code above will return &quot;green&quot;, because the compiler replaces COLOR with 
&quot;green&quot;. In the the first line of the function, x is assigned 4, because the 
compiler sees <code>x = 12 / 3;</code>.</p>
<h3>#if <i>symbol</i>, #endif</h3>
<p>These directives surround blocks of code. Code between an #if directive and 
the matching #endif will be compiled if the specified symbol was previously 
defined.</p>
<pre>#define GREEN

string func() {
  string color = "red";
#if GREEN
  color = "green";
#endif
  return color;
}</pre>
<p>In the code above, func will return &quot;green&quot;. Because the symbol GREEN was 
defined, the code in the middle of the function will be compiled.</p>
<pre>string func() {
  string color = "red";
#if GREEN
  color = "green";
#endif
  return color;
}</pre><p>In the code above, func will return "red". The code in the middle of the function
was not compiled, because GREEN had not been defined. The function was compiled 
as if the line <code>color = &quot;green&quot;;</code> did not exist.</p>
<h3>#if <i>symbol</i>, #else, #endif</h3>
<p>The #else directive can be used between an #if and an #endif, with the 
expected behavior.</p>
<pre>#define GREEN

string func() {
  string color;
#if GREEN
  color = "green";
#else
  color = "red";
#endif
  return color;
}</pre>
<p>The code above returns &quot;green&quot;, because GREEN is defined. Had GREEN not been 
defined, func would return &quot;red&quot;.</p>
<h3>#if !<i>symbol</i></h3>
<p>Using the ! operator before the symbol will test for the symbol <b>not</b> being 
defined.</p>
<pre>string func() {
  string color;
#if !RED
  color = "green";
#else
  color = "red";
#endif
  return color;
}</pre>
<p>The code above returns &quot;green&quot; because the symbol RED has not been defined.</p>
<h3>#undef <i>symbol</i></h3>
<p>Undefines the specified symbol.</p>
<pre>#define GREEN
#undef GREEN

string func() {
  string color = "red";
#if GREEN
  color = "green";
#endif
  return color;
}</pre>
<p>The code above will return &quot;red&quot;. Although GREEN was defined, it was 
undefined before the #if directive.</p>
