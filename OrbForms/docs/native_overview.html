<p>Native add-ins provide developers with the ability to extend the
functionality of OrbC, and to write performance critical functionality in
native code. A native add-in is a code resource in the form of a .prc file. When an
application that uses a native add-in is built standalone, the add-in is also
embedded into the application. This way, a standalone application is completely
self-contained, even when using native add-ins. A native add-in can also contain additional resources, such as forms or
bitmaps. These will also be embedded in the application.</p>
<h3>Using Native Add-ins</h3>
<p>In order to use the functions and structs implemented in a native library,
you must include the add-in's declaration file. To do this, add a line to the
beginning of you primary source file such as this:</p>
<code>#include &quot;addin.oc&quot;</code>
<p>This declaration file may be in the project directory, or you must supply a
relative path from the current project OR from the compiler root. For example,
to include the OrbSort native library located in the compiler's
&quot;add-ins&quot; directory:</p>
<code>#include &quot;add-ins/OrbSort.oc&quot;</code>
<h3>Using Native Gadgets </h3>
<p>Using a native gadget is the same as using any other gadget. Simply add the
gadget declaration file to the project and create a gadget in your form.</p>
<h3>Locating the Native Add-in's .PRC File</h3>
<p>When building a standalone application, the compiler will look for the native
add-in's .prc file so that its contents can be embedded in the application. To
find this, the compiler searches in this order:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The project directory</li>
  <li>The &quot;add-ins&quot; directory under the OrbForms or PocketC Architect installation
    directory (usually something like: C:\Program Files\OrbForms\add-ins or 
  C:\Program Files\PocketC Architect\add-ins)</li>
</ul>
