			<p>It seems every programming book's first program is 
always a "Hello World" example, so we will follow the tradition here. 
This example consists a minimal Palm program which simply displays a "Hello World" 
message on the screen.</p>
<p>This tutorial's goal is to get you comfortable with the tool 
and the development process. </p>
<h3>Create a Project</h3>
<table border="3" cellspacing="3" style="BORDER-COLLAPSE: collapse" bordercolor="#c0c0c0" width="100%" cellpadding="3">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
    <ul>
      <li>Select the Project menu and choose New Project</li>
    </ul>
    </td>
    <td width="50%" align="middle">
    <img border="0" src="hellol1.gif" width="177" height="108"></img></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
    <ul>
      <li>A dialog will appear and collect the project 
        related information. 
 
      <li>Please enter the project name as "HelloWorld" 
 
  <li>Enter the project location. This determines 
        where you want to store the project. 
 
  <li>Select the Basic Application Wizard. 
 
      <li>Click Finish button. </li>
    </ul>
    </td>
    <td width="50%" align="middle">
    <img border="0" src="hellol2.gif" width="487" height="384"></img></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Now the project is created, so let us briefly go through the things you see on the screen.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="hellol3.gif" ></img></p>
<ul>
  <li>The Workspace bar has two tabs, "Project" and 
  "Source". 
  <li>The Project tab shows the entire project as a tree. 
  Each tree node represents a component of the project. You can view and edit 
  their properties using the Inspection bar. 
  <li>The Source tab shows all the source files as a tree. 
  You can double click on a source file to open it (which also displays a list 
  of functions in the file). 
  <li>The Inspection bar is where you can view the properties of the currently
    selected node. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Add Customized Code</h3>
<table border="3" cellspacing="3" style="BORDER-COLLAPSE: collapse" bordercolor="#c0c0c0" width="100%" cellpadding="3">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
    <ul>
      <li>Select the root node "app" in the Workspace 
        Project, and see what appears in the Inspection bar. 
 
      <li>Property <i>PRC File</i> 
        is the final output PRC file name. For example, the output file will be 
        MyAPP.prc by default. 
 
      <li>Change the Display Name from "My App" to "Hello World". It is important to set the 
display name property since that is the name will be displayed on the device 
      powered Palm OS.</li>
    </ul>
    </td>
    <td width="50%" align="middle">
    <img border="0" src="hellol4.gif"></img></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
    <ul>
      <li>Select the mainForm node from the Workspace 
        Project. You should now see a list of properties and handlers in the 
        Inspection. 
 
      <li>Click on the "ondraw" handler. </li>
    </ul>
    </td>
    <td width="50%" align="middle">
    <img border="0" src="hellol5.gif"></img></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
    <ul>
      <li>Now the code template will be automatically inserted in the mainform.oc source file.
      If the source file wasn't already open, OrbForms Designer will open the source file 
      automatically and append the code at the end.</li>
    </ul>
    </td>
    <td width="50%" align="middle">
    <img border="0" src="hellol6.gif" width="399" height="247"></img></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
    <ul>
      <li>Edit the ondraw() handler with customized code</li>
    </ul>
    </td>
    <td width="50%" align="middle">;<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="BORDER-COLLAPSE: collapse" bordercolor="#111111">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">
<pre>handler mainForm.ondraw() {

    // create a draw object
    Draw draw;
    // attach to this form
    draw.attachForm(this);

    draw.begin();

    // write the Hello World string at the form position (40,80)
    draw.text(clrText, 40, 80, "Hello World");

    draw.end();
}</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>Compile the Project</h3>
<p>Select the Project menu and choose Build, or press the F7 key.</p>
<p>If everything goes smoothly, you should see following messages in the Output:; 
The actual build time depending on your desktop computer speed.</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0" style="BORDER-COLLAPSE: collapse" bordercolor="#111111">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%">
<pre>Compiling...
Build duration [98.86] ms
Build completed</pre>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The resulting MyApp.prc file should now be located in your project directory.</p>
<h3>Test the Application</h3>
<p>Copy the MyApp.prc file to the emulator. There are two quick 
ways to do so.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Right click on the Emulator and select Install 
  Application/Database-&gt;Others. 
  <li>Use mouse to drag the MyApp.prc to the Palm OS Emulator screen area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Go to the Palm OS application launcher on the emulator. You should see an
application named "Hello World" on the emulator. Click on the application 
and see what happens! </p>
<p><img border="0" src="helloworld.gif" width="160" height="160"></img></p>
<h3>Deliver the Final Palm Application</h3>
<p>The last but not the least, after developing your first HelloWorld program, 
you might want to share it with other friends who has Palm OS devices. 
Just give the MyApp.prc file to your friends through email attachments or 
web downloads. Make sure give them the OrbFormsRT.prc as well! </p>
<p>OrbForms Designer also allows you to build a full standalone PRC file as 
well. Just change the project root node's property <i>standalone</i> from 
FALSE to TRUE, and build the project again.</p>
<p>If you create an application that you intend to give to others, you MUST get
a unique creator id for each application. You can register a creator ID at the
Palm development site - click on the OrbForms Designer's Help menu and select
"Palm OS Creator ID" to go there. </p>
<h3>Exercise:</h3>
<p>1. Did you notice the HelloWorld program's title is "Form Title"? Can 
you give it a more appropriate name? </p>
<p>Hint: Click on the mainForm node in the Workspace Project, and take a look at the 
Inspection.</p>
<p>2. The message "Hello World" is rather meaningless. How about replace it 
with your favorite proverb or fortune cookie saying?</p>
<p>Hint: Be aware the screen width limitation. You might need to break the 
words into a few different lines.</p>
