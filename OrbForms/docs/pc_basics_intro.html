<p>PocketC Architect is the evolution of PocketC. PocketC Architect is a 
programmer's tool with a powerful language and a rich, easy-to-use, 
object-oriented API. Applications written in PocketC Architect can be compiled 
on a Windows desktop or directly on a Palm OS device.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Rapid application development</li>
  <li>Easy resource syntax for defining UI</li>
  <li>Automatic form resizing on supported devices</li>

<h3>Legacy PocketC Users</h3>
<p>Users of PocketC 7.1 or earlier gain huge advantages by using PocketC 
Architect. Most of the features listed above were not available in PocketC, 
including the rich object-oriented API, the object-oriented language features, 
the resource syntax for defining forms, and a more productive, intelligent desktop editor.</p>
<h3>OrbForms Designer Users</h3>
<p>Users of OrbForms Designer can compile their application with little or no 
modifications, because PocketC Architect uses the same OrbC compiler and runtime 
originally created for OrbForms. Using PocketC Architect allows an OrbForms 
Designer user to compile their application directly on a Palm device.</p>
