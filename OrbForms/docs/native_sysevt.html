<p>A native add-in can intercept system events by registering an event function
with OrbC using the <code>reg_event_func</code> function of the OrbC native
interface. To see an example, see the <code>hookcontrast</code> function implemented in
SampleAddIn.</p>
<p>Event handling in the Palm OS is normally implemented in a loop like this:</p>
<pre>do {
  EvtGetEvent(&amp;event, timeout);

  if (! SysHandleEvent(&amp;event))
    if (! MenuHandleEvent(0, &amp;event, &amp;error))
      if (! AppHandleEvent(&amp;event))
        FrmDispatchEvent(&amp;event);

} while (event.eType != appStopEvent);</pre>
<p>This is very similar to the way events are handled in the OrbC runtime
environment. When a native add-in registers an event function, it is called
before SysHandleEvent. If the add-in's function handles the event, it must
return true to prevent the other event functions from processing the event. When
more than one native add-in registers an event function, there are no guarantees
about which add-in will get the first chance to process the event.</p>
