<p>A project is the collection of the application properties, application icon,
forms, bitmaps, strings, source code, and gadget source code that go into an
application. An OrbForms Designer project is stored as a .orb file which
contains references to the source files, gadget files, and bitmaps files.</p>
<h3>Project Items and Names</h3>
<p>Each item in a project has a name. Each name must be unique, and must be a
valid variable name. In fact, OrbForms Designer creates an object for each item
that can be accessed from source code. Look through the tutorials to see how
this works.</p>
<h3>Application Icon</h3>
<p>A project contains one small icon and one large icon. The small icon must be
15x9 pixels, and the large icon must by 32x32. However, in the large icon, only
the top 22 lines will be visible (the lower portion is obscured by the
application name). Any pixel whose RGB color is (255,128,255), a light pink,
will be treated as transparent for 4-bit and 8-bit icons.</p>
<h3>Project Bitmaps</h3>
<p>A project can contain bitmaps, which can be used to do custom drawing in
forms and gadgets. Each bitmap can contain up to 10 images - one standard 
density and one high density for each
supported bit depth (1-, 2-, 4-, 8- and 16-bit). Any pixel whose RGB color is 
(255,128,255), a light pink, will be treated as transparent for 4-, 8-, and 16-bit 
images. When creating an
8-bit image, the compiler will convert the image to use the Palm palette. To ensure that
the bitmap looks best, create the image using the Palm palette
(Palm256Palette.pal can be used by most image editors for this purpose). High 
density images must be twice as wide and tall as standard images.</p>
<p>Bitmaps can also be added to the application via source code. See
<a href="tGadgets.html">Gadgets</a> for details.</p>
<h3>Project Strings</h3>
<p>A project may contain strings, which are represented in the project bar. A
project string is only used as the help string for a modal form - when the user
taps the &quot;i&quot; in the upper right of a modal form, the specified string
will be displayed in a help dialog.</p>
<p>Project strings can also be added to the application via source code. See
<a href="oUIString.html">UIString</a> for details.</p>
<h3>Compiling and Source File Order</h3>
<p>The order of source and gadget files in the project is significant. OrbForms
Designer compiles all the files in a project in order, essentially treating them
as one large file. For this reason functions, object, methods, global variables,
etc. defined in one file can be accessed by every file that is listed after it
in the project.</p>
<p>The project file contains an application definitions which is composed of all
the forms, controls, etc. used by the application. When a form contains a
gadget, the gadget object must be defined before the application definition. To
accomplish this, the compiler processes the gadget files before the processing
the application definition, followed by the source files. This has several
implications, which are described below.</p>
<h3>Source File Order Guidelines</h3>
<p>To make this easier to understand, here are a few guidelines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gadget objects must be defined in gadget files.</li>
  <li>The actual methods of a gadget may be defined in a source file.</li>
  <li>Gadget files may not reference the forms, controls, etc. of the
    application.</li>
  <li>Objects and global variables may only be used in the file in which they
    are defined, and the files that follow.</li>
  <li>Functions can only be used in the file in which they are <i>declared</i>,
    and the files that follow.</li>
</ul>
