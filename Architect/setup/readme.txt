---------------------------------------
PocketC Architect is a PalmOS-based compiler for the OrbC language, a C/C++
inspired language. PocketC Architect runs only on OS5+ devices, but can compile
applications for OS 3.0 and above.

PocketC Architect can compile older PocketC applications with minimal changes.

Installation:
-------------
Using your favorite PalmPilot program, install PCA.prc (the compiler),
OrbFormsRT-debug.prc or OrbForms.prc (the runtime), and MathLib.prc (which
adds a substantial number of floating-point functions such as trig functions).

---------------
PCA.prc               The PocketC Architect compiler
