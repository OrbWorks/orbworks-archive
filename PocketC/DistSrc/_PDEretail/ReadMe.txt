-----------------------

Sales Pitch:
  PocketC Desktop Edition makes it possible to create PocketC applets on
  a PC, allowing for rapid development and testing in combination with
  the Palm OS Emulator. PDE is capable of producing a standard applet
  database or a .prc with the applet code embedded. PocketC is still
  required on the target device.
