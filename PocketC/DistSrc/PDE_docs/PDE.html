<h1>PocketC Desktop Edition</h1>
<p>PocketC Desktop Edition is Windows-based editor and compiler
for the PocketC language.</p>

<h3>Compiling a File</h3>

<p>Selecting Project | Compile compiles the currently active file. The compile
dialog will open allowing you to specify an output file, along with .prc
options.</p>

<h3>Project File</h3>

<p>When you hit the compile button (or hit F7), PocketC compile the current
project file. The first file you open in PocketC is considered the project file.
To change the project file, select the Project | Set Project File menu.&nbsp; </p>

<h3>Compile Dialog </h3>

<p>Their are three forms of apps that you can generate: </p>

<ul>
  <li><b>.pdb applet file - </b>Selecting nothing in the dialog will result in a
    .pdb file. To execute it, you must launch PocketC runtime (or compiler), and
    select your applet in the list. To distribute it, you must distribute both
    the .pdb file and the PocketC runtime.</li>
  <li><b>.prc app file</b> - Selecting only the &quot;Generate .prc&quot; will
    result in a .prc file. To execute it, you select its icon from the
    application launcher. The application requires that the PocketC runtime (or
    compiler) be installed, but the user does not interact with it and need not
    be aware that it is running. To
    distribute it, you must distribute both the .prc file and the PocketC
    runtime.</li>
  <li><b>Standalone .prc app</b> - Selecting both the checkboxes will build a
    standalone application. PocketC does not need to be installed. To distribute
    it you must only distribute the .prc file (and any native libraries you
    require). This results in a much larger app file.</li>
</ul>
<h3>.prc Properties</h3>
<p>In order to generate a .prc file, you must specify the properties of the app
in your source. Each property is an '@' followed by the property name, then the
value (always a string), terminated with a semicolon. See the &quot;triangle.pc&quot;
sample for an example.</p>
<table border="0">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><code>@cid &quot;MyAp&quot;;</code></td>
    <td valign="top">The creator ID for the app. This ID must be unique for each
      application created. If you plan to distribute it, the ID <b>MUST</b> be
      registered with Palm. Register at the <a href="http://www.palmos.com/dev">PalmOS
      developer</a> site. The ID must be 4 characters, at least one of which
      must not be lowercase.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><code>@name &quot;My App&quot;;</code></td>
    <td valign="top">The name of the application as it appears in the
      application launcher.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><code>@dbname &quot;MyApp&quot;;</code></td>
    <td valign="top">The name of the database (file). Must be less than 32
      characters.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><code>@category &quot;Games&quot;;</code></td>
    <td valign="top">The name of the default launcher category this app should 
    be installed into. In order to honor multiple languages, you should specify 
    one of the predefined English categories (the OS will translate it 
    appropriately): Games, Main, System, Utilities</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><code>@ver &quot;1.0&quot;;</code></td>
    <td valign="top">A short string describing the version number, usually in
      the format MAJOR.MINOR.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><code>@licon1 &quot;icons/large1.bmp&quot;;</code></td>
    <td valign="top">1-bit/pixel large icon. This icon must be specified. You
      may optionally also specify a 2-, 4-, 8-, and 16-bit/pixel icon using <code>
      licon2</code>, <code>licon4</code>, <code>licon8</code>, and <code>licon16</code>. 
    You may also specify a double-density icon by appending 'h' to the property 
    (e.g. <code>licon8h</code>). If you use a
      '\' in the path, you must escape it, i.e. '\\'. Instead use '/'.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><code>@sicon1 &quot;icons/small1.bmp&quot;;</code></td>
    <td valign="top">1-bit/pixel small icon. This icon must be specified. You
      may optionally also specify a 2-, 4-, 8-, and 16-bit/pixel icon using <code>sicon2</code>,
      <code>sicon4</code>,
      <code>sicon8</code>, and <code>sicon16</code>. Double-density icons are 
    specified with 'h' properties (e.g. <code>sicon8h</code>).</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
<h3>Compiler Directives</h3>
<p>In order to support some advanced scenarios, you can use the following 
directives:</p>
  <table>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><code>@cmd &quot;command to be executed&quot;</code></td>
    <td valign="top">This is an optional post-build command that is executed in
      a command window (DOS prompt) in the directory of the output file. There can be multiple post-build
      commands.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><code>@bmp &quot;1200,1,a.bmp,8h,b.bmp&quot;</code></td>
    <td valign="top">Embeds a bitmap family in the .prc file, which can be drawn
      with the bitmapr() function. The string is a comma separated list. The
      first number is the resource id, which must be unique for all bitmaps.
      Next is a list of 1 or more pairs of bitmap depths and bitmap files which
      make the bitmap family (the OS will select and draw the most appropriate
      bitmap in the family). The depth can be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, or
      16h, where the number specifies the number of bits per pixel that the
      image should represent (the compiler will do the depth conversion). All
      images in the family must be the same dimensions. If the number is
      followed by an 'h', this is a high-density bitmap and its dimensions must
      be exactly twice the size of the normal-density bitmaps. You need not (and
      should not) supply all depths and sizes. To make part of an 8-bit/pixel icon transparent, set the pixel color to RGB 
    (255, 128, 255), which is a pale pink. This directive can only be used 
    when building a .prc file.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><code>@res &quot;type,1,file.bin&quot;</code></td>
    <td valign="top">Embeds a the contents of a given file in the application. 
    The first parameter is a 4-character resource type, the second parameter is 
    the resource id, and the final parameter is the name of the file to embed. 
    This directive can only be used when building a .prc file.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>Icons</h3>
<p>Icons are defined in bitmap files of any color depth. The large icons must be
32 x 32, 32 x 22, or 22 x 22 pixels. If more than one large icon is specified,
they must all be the same dimensions. The small icon must be 15 x 9 pixels.</p>
<p>To make part of an 8-bit/pixel icon transparent, set the pixel color to RGB
(255, 128, 255), which is a pale pink. It is recommended that you use 24-bit
bitmap files for this to ensure that the desired pixel color is not changed to
match a predefined palette.</p>
<h3>QuickDocs</h3>
<p>When you place the cursor on a function name, it displays the function
declaration along with short documentation. The documentation for built-in
functions is provided by the compiler. However, you can add documentation to
your own functions very easily by adding an @doc directive before the function
definition. For example:</p>
<pre>@doc &quot;Create a new button&quot;;
addButton(int x, int y, string name) { ... }</pre>
<p>This can also be used in the ".lib" files for native libraries - just add the @doc before each
function declaration.</p>
<h3>Using Native Libraries</h3>
<p>To use a native library within PocketC Desktop Edition, you must have the
native library's &quot;.lib&quot; file in the same directory as the source code
that uses it. Use the library keyword followed by the name of the
&quot;.lib&quot; file without the file extension. For example:</p>
<p><code>library &quot;PToolboxLib&quot;</code></p>
<h3> Native Libraries Setup</h3>
<p>In order to have the PocketC Desktop Edition's editor highlight native
library functions and provide parameter help, you must add the .lib file to the
list of native libraries. To do this, select the Project | Native Library Setup
menu item and add the .lib file.</p>
<h3>Uploading to the Emulator</h3>
<p>The application's .prc or .pdb will be automatically installed on the
emulator if it is running. If the .prc/.pdb file on the device is in use (i.e.
the application is running), the file will not upload successfully.</p>
<h3>Compiling from the Command Line</h3>
<p>You may launch PocketC Desktop Edition from the command line to have it
compile a file without loading the editor. Use PDE.exe /? for details.</p>
