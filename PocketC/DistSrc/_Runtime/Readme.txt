PocketC is a PalmOS-based C compiler. This, however, is a freeware runtime-only
version. For information regarding the full version, which allows you to write
and compile your own applets, visit our website.

PocketC only works with OS 2.0 and up.

Installation:
-------------
Using your favorite PalmPilot program, install PocketC.prc. Additionally, you
may also install MathLib.prc (which adds a substantial number of floating-
point functions such as trig functions). This runtime version will replace any
other installed version of PocketC.

                       floating point functions.
