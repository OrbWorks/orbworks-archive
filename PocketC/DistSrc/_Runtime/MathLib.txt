MathLib is not required for the use of PocketC. However, many floating point
functions are not available if MathLib does not reside on your PalmPilot. See
the library routines documentation to see which functions require MathLib.

MathLib is a free shared library that can be used by any OS 2.0 Pilot program
that needs IEEE 754 double precision math functions. It's distributed under the
terms of the GNU General Public License, and is freely available with full
source code and documentation at the MathLib Information web page. It's not a
part of the PocketC program, and you're not paying anything for its use; a copy
is simply included in this archive for your convenience.
