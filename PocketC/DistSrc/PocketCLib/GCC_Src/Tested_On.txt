[Tutorial and GCC files provided by Mark Roth]

Will not run on 1.0 rom.
Runs on 2.0 rom but crashes back into the prefs on exit.
Installs but didn't show up in Launcher on 3.0 rom most likely due to some stupidity on my part.
Runs on 3.1 rom.
Runs on 3.2 rom.
Runs on 3.3 rom.
Runs on 3.5 rom.
Runs on 4.0 rom.
Runs on 4.1 rom.

Thats all my roms and I don't want to update tonite. Tested haphazardly by Mark Roth on all roms and it seems to work fine.

The tutorial is in GCC_native_tutorial.txt for compiling a native library for PocketC using GCC.
