---------------------------------------
PocketC is a PalmOS-based C compiler. The current version is a shareware
application. Registration is available at www.palmgear.com

PocketC does not support the Pilot 1000/5000. The PalmPilot Personal is not
supported unless upgraded.

Applets created with version 5.0+ will not run with on previous versions
of the compiler/runtime! However, previously compiled applets and native libs
will work with the new compiler/runtime.

Installation:
-------------
Using your favorite PalmPilot program, install PocketC.prc. Additionally, you
may also install MathLib.prc (which adds a substantial number of floating-
point functions such as trig functions), and Tic-Tac-Toe.pdb, a sample applet.

PocketC.prc      The PocketC application
MathLib.prc      The free math shared library. See MathLib.txt for details.

                       floating point functions.
