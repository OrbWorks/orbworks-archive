How do I distribute my app?
There are three options:
1. You can distribute your app as an applet file (.pdb)
This means that a user will run your app by launching PocketC (either the compiler or the free runtime), selecting your app from the list, and pressing the Execute button.
2. You can distribute your app as an applet file with a launch app (.pdb + .prc)
Use BuildPRC to build a application stub. This stub will sit in the application launcher. When selected, it will launch PocketC with the applet you've created.
3. You can distribute your app as a application (.prc)
With PocketC Desktop Edition, you can distribute your file as a single .prc file. It will appear to the user as if this is a native application, except that they will need to have PocketC installed. If PocketC is not installed, the application will let the user know that they need to install it.
